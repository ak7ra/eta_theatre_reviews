Twelfth Night,Twelfth Night is a New Perspective at the National,Christopher Adams,golden brown leaves decorate the edges of the stage in  halls production of twelfth night for the national theatre. the relatively small and intimate cottesloe is the site for halls 80th birthday work directing his own daughter rebecca hall as  amid a star studded cast including simon callow as sir  belch. but the fallen leaves are indicative of a mood that seeps through this performance one of contemplation and reflection as  hall one of the most influential british stage directors of the past century conjures a twelfth night suffused with questions about language and perspective. several of the cast appeared in halls production of midsummer nights dream at the rose theatre   kingston in early 2010. making the transition are  edwards who as  in midsummer nights dream was bizarrely reminiscent of flash gordon as sir  aguecheek and ben mansfield as  among others. finty s gives an energetic and pitch perfect performance as . simon paisley day is classic  uptight self obsessed and partly deformed in his attempts to smile. his torment at the hands of sir topas occurs while he is chained in a large birdcage blindfolded. it is a grim picture. callow is a strong sir  adding energy and not always good natured levity to the action there is a bitterness and anger that clouds this character giving justification for  amanda drew to be annoyed with him. david ryalls  is much more subdued than other s a jester gone to seed relying on his still sharp wit but drained by time and age from deploying it fully. his performance strongly hints that  discovers the  doubling but chooses to remain silent on the subject. underlined in ryalls performance is s role as philologist concerned about words and their usage how words are both necessary but  slippery. by paying such careful attention to the language the production highlights s constant use of extended metaphor. while sir  and  can be quick witted and with seeming ease pursue their thoughts to satisfying conclusions much of the humor of sir  aguecheek derives from his inability to follow suit. when  prompts now sir thought is free. i pray you bring your hand to th buttry bar and let it drink she takes sir s hand and places it on her bosom. edwards managing brilliantly to look aroused disquieted and confused all at the same time can only respond wherefore sweetheart? whats your metaphor? designer  ward situates the action in jacobean caroline dress with the men in long silky locks which has the benefit of allowing rebecca halls hair to remain down not cut short or pushed up under a hat as in many productions. the design promotes the feminization of the masculine rather than the other way round. marton csokass  appears in a sweeping patterned robe and his ungainly rings of hair de down his back like a lions mane. indeed csockas presents  as a languid king of the jungle at one point touching his hand to his mouth as a lion would lick its paw. his utter absorption in his feelings for  underscores a listless narcissism. much also is made of sir s graceful golden tresses but it becomes me well enough doest not? he says to callows sir  clearly a matter of pride. but when sir  berates sir  in the final scene one of the most serious and uncomfortable moments in the production he reaches for sir s head and attacks his hair revealing the finely primped hair to be nothing more than a wig a masterful touch revealing everything the audience needs to know about the character and the aguecheek sir  relationship. the stage itself is a mostly simple affair. a large canvas hangs over the stage and lowers at different points. a table and benches for the rowdy scenes appear and disappear as needed. most striking are the images of distorted cities and houses in the background which make sense only toward the end when  seeing  and  together says one face one voice one habit and two persons a natural perspective that is and is not like s preoccupation with the slipperiness of language the audiences view of the stage is something that both is and is not. the production tends toward the traditional and straightforward and its humor is more subdued than other twelfth nights but in its reflective melancholy it allows the language room to breathe and strains of thought time to be coherently delineated.,3,Comedy,Negative
Twelfth Night,Twelfth Night Offers Clarity with Complications ,Claudine Nightingale, ive been eagerly awaiting the arrival of  dorans latest take on twelfth night in london since the royal  company first performed it in stratford upon avon back in october 2009. yet again the casting of a well known celebrity helps ensure a healthy number of sales richard wilson is no david tennant many may argue but hes attraction enough for the demographic core of britains theatregoing public. despite my eagerness i also approach this show with some trepidation. this is a play that lives close to my heart. performed well it can evoke every degree of emotion from despair to hilarity which makes it all the sadder if these many opportunities are missed. between the interesting and thorough programme notes and the lively and colourful combination of set sound and costume design its clear that much meticulous research has taken place. doran was keen to create an illyria close to land. the warm moroccan feeling depicted onstage gives the experiences of those newly shipwrecked on this strange land a unique tangibility. although it is fair to say s characters have very english natures the land in which they live is intended to be unknown new and exciting. also reable is the sheer clarity of the text again a tribute to dorans thorough and renowned approach to directing. he somehow brings absolute understanding to the audience be it a deliberate gesture a subtle but explanatory prop an emphasis on wordplay or a momentary pause the meaning is eked out. this careful and effective approach results in a highly coordinated performance with props and music working for the text rather than fighting for supremacy over it. in the opening scene the musical accompaniment perfectly reflects s speech even with the dying fall. sir s flatulence and sir s long flowing locks are tied in seamlessly to the text their presence fortified through their demonstrable relevance. jo stone fewings gives a commanding performance as  although i couldnt help but wish for a little more tempestuousness in him especially in the climactic patience on a monument scene. james fleets sir  aguecheek is also delivered with a great deal of charm and warmth but the chemistry between fleet and richard mccabes sir  lacks spark. perhaps one of the finest comedy duos in history fell a little flat with a too reserved sir . the role of  is always a demanding one but nancy carroll handles it admirably achieving a marvellous balance of earnestness convincing cross gender action and well executed humorous asides. miltos yerolemou as  is too farcical for my liking with not enough of this characters intelligent and mysterious qualities shining through. his delivery of songs is also disappointing. theyre such a critical part of s role and im not sure yerelemou has the vocal dexterity to give them justice. richard wilson gives a very well received performance as  and appears in delightfully obscene yellow cross gartered stockings that trail all the way up his thighs. but i was still left wishing for something more. although theres no doubt audiences feel a great deal of sympathy for the tricked and tortured  as the subplot unfolds wilson doesnt take us on s emotional journey because he is simply too likeable and sincere in his actions to be truly disliked by the audience at any point in the play. thus we cannot be amazed by our own change of hearts. we simply like him throughout and this simplicity proves a complication for wilson. complications aside this is a twelfth night of great merit. the clarity of textual meaning is by far the most outstanding quality of this production and something that makes it a joy to watch understand and enjoy. ,4,Comedy,Positive
Twelfth Night,Twelfth Night Goes for Synthesis through Antithesis,Denise Battista,hear ye hear ye  at stinson beach is now north bay  located in novato. theres definitely some give and take in the move. no more pre performance beach walks and you can bid adieu to the intimacy of the stinson location amidst the flowers and the trees. the new digs are located about fifteen minutes down the road highway 101 at the hamilton amphitheater park in novato. after a short trek through the park youll enter a beautiful large stone amphitheatre set amidst the trees. perhaps north bay will stage something ancient next season. a gory titus or the heart wrenching et tu brute? the entire amphitheatre could be the stage. just a critics suggestion  artistic director jeffrey trotter is still the consummate host and as before theres preshow picnicking you can bring your own or preorder quite the gourmet spread from café joel and north bay shakes will have your feast waiting for your arrival. of notable interest are the real bathrooms. no more portable rigmarole thank the gods. director marybeth cavanaugh hits us with a provocative production although the acting is sometimes uneven. the stage is not much to speak of at first glance. mirroring left to right stand red partitions torn black curtains two pillars serving no particular purpose in front of a blue curtained backdrop and a black and white stage floor designed with diamond patterns. there seems to be method here however with the stage resembling the colors and design of arlecchino a.k.a. harlequin the fool from the italian commedia dellarte. kalli jonsson plays the corresponding fool  as an intriguing although cynical weathered character who offers mildly energetic riddles and even less boisterous songs when not sipping from a small bottle of something at the perimeter of the stage. perhaps theres method here as well. theres a battle underway in this play as well as in s england pitting festive and saturnalian disorderliness against the puritanical pressures in s post reformation england.in one corner theres the hysterical team of sir  belch kevin karrick and sir  aguecheek gendell hernandez versus the sour and dour  played to perfection by grand comedian clive worsley in the other while jonssons  is pitted somewhere in the middle of it all.karrick is the equivalent of a middle aged frat boy complete with hawaiian and cocktail while hernandez represents his real life cuban heritage sporting a cuba jogging suit with breakaway pants and a stereotypically fiery temperament. one doesnt really get the notion that belch is taking advantage of the financially advantageous aguecheek in this production rather the two stick together like tacky glue riding the coattails of mardi gras a place one might find a harlequin or ten or enacting bottle rocket like heists with hysterical ca caws before staging a drop and roll. at the other end of the spectrum is . worsley is a petite man wearing a three piece suit and bowtie as well as a squiggmann of hair that juts from his forehead. he leans far back when he speaks and moves not his upper body when he walks keeping his elbows close to his sides while his hands do the talking. one cant help but laugh as worsley calls upon every ounce of stanislavski training hes had when cracking a smile on his perfectly sour puss or when he does a solitary tango of sorts round the stage while donning his yellow cross gartered stockings for the beauteous  camille thornton alson. but when worsley is imprisoned and left to the medieval and freudian pseudotherapy of sir topaz laughter becomes uncomfortable and comingled with sympathy and perhaps a bit of empathy for one who is vilely wronged and publicly humiliated. frankly id like to see  in a sequel all his own. id like to see him get his revenge and id like to see worsley represent. our protagonist  is sometimes as bland as her ill fitting khakis white button down and tennies get this woman to a fashion consultant please but the somewhat masculine valerie weak is brilliant in soliloquy and proves a frighteningly spot on mirror for her long lost twin brother  played by the somewhat feminine and unfortunately more bland than brilliant robert bergin.bergins interactions with  g. randall wright are flaccid with any possible love interest as it is oftentimes played between the two left undeveloped.  is a far cry from the crème de la crème of s strong women. shes no  and shes certainly no  but weak does a strong job of portraying a woman who is dressed as a man who has no idea how to act like a man but somehow pulls it off. and speaking of pulling it off weaks grand reveal falls flat as she removes her shirt and chiron alston  unbinds her breasts to an end that reiterates that this is a family friendly theatre. a bit more risk tasteful of course would provide an impact and would likely fill the amphitheatre. violinist paul festa provides much of the music in this production with alston accompanying every note with a dramatic lovesick sigh. jonssons  is a tad out of tune but his songs are sometimes strengthened by cara burgoynes  charming voice. antithesis reaches its peak and direction achieves a bit of genius when the always drunk belch and aguecheek exchange lines in defiance of s demands for midnight silence in his ladys house to the tune of nirvanas come as you are. later festa opens the second half of the play with the tune on his violin and one cant help but recount the lyrics filled with depressing antitheses and destructive images only to be followed by  who backs onto the stage and out of her state of mourning in order to sweetly conjure and prepare for scenarios with her supposed love interest . but back to  whose name represents the spirit of the sir s and aguecheeks festival and is the polar opposite to the ill will demonstrated in s name. jonsson seems to be stuck in the middle of both. as the fool he riddles and sings and he tricks the others for fun and out of their coins. in the beginning of the play other characters embrace him with explosive joy upon sight. he is also oftentimes a spectator to the action on this stage left in disregard on the perimeter in his long and worn neutrally colored coat and with an unused drum slung around his shoulder. when left on his own he watches he sleeps or he drinks from his small bottle always with an air of sadness.jonssons eyes are blackened in the shape of diamonds and a single tear is outlined underneath reiterating the antithesis of his spirit and of the play in general. as the sky darkens in novato this festive fool turns ghoulish when the stage strategically lights his face from below. once embraced he is now left alone to end the play on a dour note with kurt cobains repetitious memoria circling the stage.,4,Comedy,Positive
Twelfth Night,"Shakespeare Set in the Summer of Love: ""There's Life in it, Man""",Denise Battista,i was born in the 70s but that doesnt mean i wasnt and im not affected by the power of the 60s. the eternal building blocks of music play on the cyclical phenomenon of fashion marches on the fabulously liberal ability of my city to urge me from time to time to put flowers in my hair and the energy that draws me into the streets to protest what has left our country shaken and wan with care. theatreworks production of twelfth night directed by theatreworks founder and artistic director robert kelley plays with the brighter side of the 60s leaving the wars to be fought in another play. with original music composed by tony award nominee jane eyre 2000 paul gordon and undoubtedly one of the grooviest set designs twelfth night has yet to see this production is high fantastical. the heavy hitters are by all measures scenic designer andrea bechert and costume designer allison connor. the backdrop is reminiscent of  maxs cosmic art mixing the sun the stars and the golden gate over the san  bay in a rainbow of bold otherworldly colors while center stage sits a looming platform on four legs creating the optical illusion of the actors walking on the air of this other world. the rotating set and reminiscent props recall the poster art of the byrds 1967 concert at the fillmore the bold simplicity inspired by the yellow submarine the psychedelic lettering of wes wilson street signs letting you know you are standing on the haight ashbury corner of history and the overall iconicizing of the late 60s as a mythical and magical place. we even get a broken down lovepeace van entering stage left in representation of s ship that wrecks on the coast of this fantastic and uncertain place. connors costume design is equally brilliant dressing duke  michael gene sullivan in hendrix inspired pre darkdrug over induced days purple velour bellbottoms a beaded fringe jacket and a long bandana while  patrick alparone plays the patched fool in another hendrix inspired colorful patchwork jacket. vilma silva as  evolves into the long silken jumpsuits of janis joplin while carie kawa goes from embroidered go go dress to a member of sergeant peppers lonely hearts club band. these fab sergeant peppers jackets also dress rafael untalan who plays s lost at sea twin brother  as well as michael ching complete with handlebar moustache who along with clive worsley causes a bit of confusion by doubling as the captain of s van and s sea captain respectively while also joining  as musical fools. fools alparone ching and worsley play their guitars and bongo drum while delivering some amazing twangy folk rock music and songs throughout this production. most memorable is worsleys moving accompaniment to  and s strobe lit musings on the cruelty of love. this is the first  production ive seen that leads a lady to lengthen her hair in order to disguise herself as a man. kawa covers her short hip do with a shoulder length wig in tune with the times and in order to match the natural locks of untalan. kawa is endearing on all levels. she is both the lover and the well deserved loved and she is a witty complement for any on this stage. kawa and sullivan prove a perfect match wearing fresh faces and an optimistic demeanor filled with hope of a brighter day. all the women in this production are strong and independent radical and empowered and motivated to achieve what they desire. this is in ed contrast to the love musings of  the singing fools and the cocktails and cannabis that cause sir  aguecheek darren bridgett to come down with a terrible case of the munchies thank god for oreos. bridgett and warren david keith as sir  belch the wavy gravy days offer loads of comedy some bootie shaking and bridgetts signature move that takes him into the audience. the only possible downer to this sky high production is the wronged and notoriously abused  played to perfection by ron campbell. rather than dampen the mood campbell adds to this plays comedy from the first moment he opens his frog like mouth with a low and creaky yes. shannon warrick as  as well as campbell bridgett and keith dominate the stage in a mist of bug spray and quick comedic timing during the letter scene ending with campbells constipated smile and leading to a pair of tie dyed cross gartered yellow stockings. its difficult to feel too sorry for  here even when hes thrown into the dungeon via a pit center stage at the mercy of sir is it swami satchidananda? topas. campbell emerges amidst clouds of smoke with dark shades and a flower in his hair while random hands reach up offering him a hit before pulling him back down below. it is only campbells recurring emphasis on the word hope that strikes a chord but his lack is more than counterbalanced by the hope inspired by the amazing generation that inspired this production. in true theatreworks holiday season fashion you dont have to be a flower child to understand and thoroughly enjoy this festive production of twelfth night. this happening is engaging and appropriate for the 60s child and the millennium child alike assuming you dont mind a little smoke out at your be in. theres life in it man. vivid psychedelic cosmic nostalgic bold and beautiful life. so sit back and let the evening go im sure you will enjoy the show.,5,Comedy,Positive
Twelfth Night,Big Things Come in Small Packages,Carrie Cleaveland,city lits production of twelfth night proves that big things do come in small packages. the theater is small and the stage is smaller forcing some creative thinking in terms of set design and staging. the actors however bring something stellar to the show and transform what could have been a low key production into a truly tremendous show. this is in large part thanks to tiffany joy ross who is brilliant as  the plays lead. she does double duty not only does she act the part she acts the part of a character acting a part. there is a difference between playing a boy and playing a girl playing a boy a fine line maybe but ross walks it with ease. she is emotional and tragic in her first scene in which she still is a woman. ross range for grief is incredible and very believable but her real charm is the way she portrays a young man while not entirely losing her girlish sensibilities. whether making mooney eyes at  jeremy cudd looking shocked or confused at s vanessa greenway unwanted affections or collapsing into hysterical high pitched weeping and foot stomping at the prospect of a duel she sparkles in her scenes.another highlight is frank nalls portrayal of sir  belch. after this performance everyone will want this fun and hilarious character as their drinking buddy. with his ham handed and perfectly over the top performance however robert mclean as  steals the show every second he is onstage. as the pompous servant vying for  mclean is unctuous and uproarious disturbing and delightful malicious and marvelous. no gesture or expression is thrown away even in the background of certain scenes you cant stop watching or laughing. the sets unfortunately are lackluster. a series of wooden frames protrude from the floor and hang from the ceiling some of which are used as doorways some of which are merely decorative. behind all these hangs a white curtain which is backlit with different color filters depending on the scene. this company have a very small space to work with so an underscored set design is necessary but the color changing curtain could have done more for the changing scenes and the mood of each act. by playing this up even more and by using more extensive props the show probably could have done away with the prointruding frames altogether. costumes are well suited to the performance though they fail to be a real highlight of the show. every character looks their part but their clothing seems more an afterthought than a carefully planned costuming scheme lacking consistency with some of the choices some men wear knee high boots while others simple dress shoes. this hardly distracts from the action and is more than compensated for by this troupes admiral job at tackling  for the first time. deserving of both our laughter and our hands city lit strives to please.,4,Comedy,Positive
Twelfth Night,The Two Sirs Steal the Show in Twelfth Night,Claudine Nightingale,everything in twelfth night is about contrast between love and despair between companionship and isolation between comedy and tragedy and between genders. despite the light hearted nature of many scenes the play explores several weighty issues which require a certain subtlety of performance if they are to successfully come across. the drama centre londons final year students performance at the cochrane theatre is pleasantly surprising. walking in the set is simple yet striking with the actors already on stage assuming their parts. this tactic effectively serves to create the feeling that the audience is walking in on something real already in existence and not awaiting any curtains or cues. a sloping path up stage adds another dimension for the actors exits and entrances. the integration of video footage and image projection allows for swift and seamless scene changes and prove most effective during the shipwreck and seaside scenes. despite this the quick shift from s court to  washing up on the illyrian shore is somewhat ineffective. the staging does facilitate quick scene changes but timing must be perfect in order to illusively change the atmosphere on stage.  lindiwe hasa enters through the audience and bursts onstage with some impact not at all suitable for a sister who just lost her twin brother at sea. emily brown has an instant presence on stage fitting snugly into her role from the outset. flirtation between brown and sir  belch luke allen gale is established very early on creating a deliciously outgoing and unabashed . allen gale takes some time to successfully gain the nuances and appearance of an older bloke but by the end of his initial scene the mannerisms of a portly middle aged drunkard seem to come more naturally. as the play progresses allen gale becomes a wonderfully warm and comedic focus dominating the stage each time he appears. alex felton as sir  aguecheek delivers a stellar performance. he and sir  share a fantastically jovial and immature friendship that welds the play together. there is also however something exceptional about feltons performance in its own right. every time he walks on stage the audience is compelled to laugh and is captivated by his playful eccentricity. felton portrays sir  as a loveable character although clearly a little foolish. we do not laugh to ridicule him because his idiosyncratic behaviour is endearing a difficult emotion to draw from an audience. the trouble with such performances is they can overpower those that require an altogether more subtle but equally challenging character portrayal.  is one of s most languishing exasperating characters. he enjoys dwelling melodramatically in the torments and trials of love more than on the object that he claims to desire and yet this doesnt quite materialise at any point in this performance. i was hoping for heated outbursts anguished poses erratic movements and over expressive stances of despair but no such actions manifest themselves in howard  portrayal of duke . a slightly less static performance would have allowed the outbursts of so strong a passion as love doth give my heart to burst forth and spill onto the stage. thomas futerill as  gives a strong performance offering his portrayal of a wise yet isolated man. although his wit shines through in his lines a less obvious approach with his word play would perhaps offer the necessary subtlety of the fools wisdom and intelligence.  jack fairweather offers a promising performance that blossoms as the play progresses. very much part of the staff and in the background initially he slowly emerges arrogant in every way and crowns it all with his exuberant yellow cross gartered stockings a scene in which fairweather shines.  tom cornish gives a solid eloquent performance each line beautifully and carefully delivered. the only slight misgiving with his character is his costume which seems out of place with the loosely 1920s style that dominates the costume design.  roxanne stutchbury like  sadly does not convince that she feels anything like love for . she does however offer a fair interpretation of s vague disdain and lack of interest for everything else. as he does with reasonable success throughout various other points in the play  brings the performance to a close with a song accompanied by the splattering sound of raindrops. the audio visual effects work well and s singing provides a suitably atmospheric ending. in a performance with student actors about to embark on their careers on the stage one can not demand too much from the fledgling cast and yet many performers show reable talent and potential as the up and coming theatrical faces of the future.,3,Comedy,Negative
Twelfth Night,Twelfth Night in Twenties Time Warp,Claudine Nightingale,the grounds of londons largest outdoor theatre hidden in the depths of regents park is the ideal setting for a traditional  production twinkling lights the terracotta stage emerging from the surrounding woodland like the weathered remains of a romantic castle wall. sadly on this occasion no such traditional production would adorn this idyllic setting. instead a very definite 1920s theme is imposed upon the text. i choose the word imposed very deliberately. im not against a fresh interpretation of  through a change in setting era etc. but it needs to complement the original text. whilst the potential for adaptation of twelfth night into a 1920s setting is evident in the success of this performance i cant help but feel that this isnt a production of s twelfth night set in the 1920s but a  play that really wants to be a vintage hollywood film. the scenes provoking the most laughter from the audience are those with extra material relevant to the time period and not the play. scenes such as the alcohol fuelled sing a long between sir  sir   and  offer ample comedic potential in the text and yet it feels as though this material is being bypassed to make way for the inclusion of other brainstorms more befitting the concept of the production. perhaps im turning into one of those purists. the theme is consistently and innovatively applied creating an entertaining performance. it is well performed and dramatically executed but it feels like a production which is a little embarrassed that its . unfortunately this slight misfit continues in the portrayal of . clive rowe gives an electric performance that steals the limelight from others every moment hes on stage. his singing is captivating and his boisterous farcical physical approach to comedy has the audience in stitches. his noteworthy performance fits well and is the lynch pin in the productions theme and setting. yet this boisterous character is not the  i know and love. rather than intelligent mysterious and melancholic we are faced with a brash and literally foolish jester. the casting of sir  and sir  too are sadly unexpected although tim woodward as sir  works hard to portray the lovable rogue with reasonable success.  richard ocallaghan is reassuringly as he should be  perfectly obtuse and distasteful obnoxious and delightfully arrogant. similarly the casting of the twins natalie dew as  and neet mohan as  is a particular success both in terms of their similarity and the commanding performances they both offer. the patience like a monument scene between  natalie dew and  oscar pearce is a particular highpoint performed with the appropriate level of intensity and passion that this scene demands including the fervent and unexpected ripping off of s shirt. sound and lighting effects are a triumph creating a dramatic and exciting atmosphere and contributing greatly to the productions overall cinematic feel. edward dicks direction and editing of scenes also works well in achieving this goal. in the end this is an entertaining production with several commendable performances and impressive sound and lighting techniques. if only it didnt so desperately wish it was a 1920s film rather than a  play.,3,Comedy,Negative
Twelfth Night,Always Loving the One You Can't Have,Roseanne Wells,the hudson river lapped at the dock side amphitheater in riverbank state park waiting for twilight and twelfth night. pulse ensemble theatres harlem summer  project now in its fourth year presents this production with highs and lows but to an audience who fully embraces the show. with the sound and smell of the water a simple backdrop from  mcdermott suffices to set this new york adaptation. an initial chase scene set to led zepplins whole lotta love creates the symbolic motif of running after the ever elusive whether in love body or truth and ushers in the flimsy theme of the elite fitness obsessed. sean fredericks  jogs in starting the play if music be the food of love then overdoses himself and the audience with zepplins great hit looped over and over. he only skims the surface of falling for  at least insofar as the great tradition of playing this illyrian duke. with great commitment fredericks demonstrates s shows of love which inevitably prevent him from seeing the love in front of him. raushanah simmonss  is a true lady though her blue blood runs cold at first. a washed up survivor of a torrential storm her aristocratic stiff upper lip comes across as prissy instead of noble. but in s dashing blue pinstripe suit simmons relaxes allowing s most endearing gentleman qualities to serve  as a page friend and secret admirer. r.j. fosters  matches  with gentility and courtly grace even though he is never given enough stage time in the play to be more than s brother and s friend. in any case this has always been enough for . in this production director alexa kelly characterizes her by her willingness to trade up for whatever suits her fancy just then. the stereotype of the upper east side nouveau riche is highlighted by s performing the motions of fitness without ever committing fully to one regimen flitting between weights isolations and yoga like a quick change artist. it seems to fit the characters denial of her brothers death that she searches for something to fill the void but the constant movement proves obnoxious as her opening scene progresses. out of her aerobic attire annie pauls  seems very young and boisterous not disagreeable but not quite congruent with the text. the audiences favorite character is clearly  as the group delights in the subplot rich with intentional schadenfreude. brian richardson shines in his delightfully hideous bumblebee striped jacket sunshine yellow shorts and knee socks another hint of kristine kourys snappy and on point costume sensibility. when attired as a butler richardson is dressed in stuffy concert tails and carrying a riding crop a literal and symbolic attempt to gain control. the crop provides ample material for physical comedy but unlike the cross garters written into the script the crop is superfluous and becomes foolish instead of hilarious. richardsons performance is strengthened when he loses it his physical comedic timing delighting the audience as the show progresses. but his gestures are too flamboyant for a true puritan forcing the audience to accept his love for  through words only. he also elicits no sympathy from the viewer as his fate turns downward giving the audience plenty to laugh about but not a lot to ponder. although richardsons uncomplicated but entertaining  wins many people to the production the most wonderful moment in the play comes from . it has always troubled me that s love is turned instantly from  to the newly revealed . he has always loved  in some productions with more homoeroticism than others but he claims that his true love is for the countess. it fits together nicely that he will marry  but are his feelings for  negated with his future nuptial? whether actors or directors choice this production brings new light to this subject. after the duke proclaims that he and  will stay with  until they find the captain and sort the matter out before the weddings he gives her a loving hug. he then looks at her. within this singular look i could see all the love that he earnestly proclaimed for her all the hurt he shouldered with her refusals to see him all the heartache he feels in letting her go with . his love is not sticky sweet with sentimentality it is so overwhelming and all encompassing that her happiness comes before his own. it is in this moment that i felt compelled into the play and its romantic ending painful open wounds healing just beneath the surface.,3,Comedy,Negative
Twelfth Night,Roses Doth Fall at the Shakespeare Theatre,Georgina Petronella,twelfth night is often considered s last true comedy.  king lear  and other such lighthearted frolics follow and you can see some hints in twelfth night of the darkness to come. not everyone finds a happy ending and the comedy cs into sadism at times. the  theatres production handles this strangely bitter comedy with aplomb however its power is dulled by some limp acting. as a twin myself the opening to twelfth night has always made me a little uneasy. our heroine  washes up on the shores of illyria after losing her twin brother  at sea. thus cleaved in two she disguises herself as a boy both for protection and perhaps as a subconscious attempt to revive her other half. bereaved and friendless she finds employment as a page boy in the service of duke  who orders the newly frocked  to court an unmoved lady friend countess  on his behalf. the wooing backfires however when  falls for the comely page boy instead. while the rich people play at love their servants play at revenge in a sort of precursor to upstairsdownstairs comedies. s household steward  is a little too high handed in his treatment of the members of the household including s fool  her attendant  her drunken uncle sir  belch and his foppish drinking buddy sir  aguecheek.  sir  and sir  plot and execute a mean spirited practical joke to repay  for his pomposity. things get out of hand for all involved until  seems like the only sane person in all of illyria. and then  surprise shows up confusing matters even more. director rebecca bayla taichman who previously directed the sexy taming of the shrew for the company finds most of the meat here in the secondary characters. although the play is principally about the shipwrecked  samantha soule and her adventures down the rabbit hole soule is continuously upstaged by the antics of the natives. floyd king is often cast in the  theatres productions and no wonder. he has extraordinary confidence and ease with the language. this frees him from battling with the traps of s tongue twisters as he digs deeply into the role of . this  is a study in contrasts nimble yet weary sweet yet malicious pragmatic yet wistful.  carries around a beat up squashed old hat that he uses to demand pay for his antics. the prop is a clever touch implying that  has tired of jokes for their own sake. if he is going to perform then he will be compensated for his trouble. ted van griethuysen is the other big reason to see this show imbuing  with considerable humanity and nuance. take s exit line in which the steward vows revenge for a cruel trick that has been played on him. the line is often played for laughs but van griethuysen delivers the line with such wounded hurt that i immediately sided with him over his zany tormentors. another tasty morsel in the cast is tom story who plays sir  aguecheek one of the aforementioned tormentors. story doesnt illicit guffaws so much as darkly amused snickers as he completely forgoes any snippet of dignity to play this idiot. it is a good thing the underbelly of illyria is so enticing because the masters and mistresses are not so much. christopher innvar who was visceral and scorching as  in taichmans shrew is bland here as duke  and generates little heat with soule. soule is difficult to understand rushing through her lines in a thin soft voice.  katona as her twin  is too eager by half. i felt much more comfortable in the hands of the veteran actors and was ready for the young pups to vamoose whenever they appeared on stage. and now a word about the petals. 41000 red rose petals are dropped per show which makes my inner stagehand want to curl up and die. the petal showers are absolutely gorgeous. they drop whenever a character falls in love signifying the randomness and quickness and perhaps the superficiality of cupids arrow. they also amusingly undercut the solemnity of falling in love. the set by riccardo hernandez is lovely as well all deep crimson reds and swirling angles. the costumes by miranda hoffman are timeless with a dash of bohemia. there is also live music provided by five musicians and a singer. the music is haunting and dramatic and weaves through the evening adding sensuousness and depth. taichman again demonstrates her sure hand as a director delivering an evocative production that showcases her flair for the visually striking. be prompt because the shows opening is breathtaking. shes a valuable asset to the theater and i hope to see her work again albeit with a few different casting choices. taichmans only major stumble occurs during the final scene of the night in which  sings about the whirligig of time. king performs the ballad like its a funeral dirge for his mother and the whole effect is just weird and out of place. for the most part though taichman balances the light and dark halves of twelfth night adding depth to former and levity to the latter.,4,Comedy,Positive
Twelfth Night,A Twelfth Night Stand You Won't Forget,Nairi Najarian, like a runaway train last metro companys inaugural production of what you will or twelfth night crashes into the fourth wall with such force that its debris afterbirth would rival that of icelands latest upchuck. this is an ambitious feat for the fledgling theater company whose founding members frank astran lovelle liquigan and christine terrisse opted to trade in their apartment play readings for this roomier arena with ample legroom. enter the arthur murray dance studio in sherman oaks ca a venue thats seen a lot of leg. the dance space turned theater is decorated with scant draping and gauzy curtains to block out the wall to wall mirrors and doors. theres cabaret style seating with tables and chairs sectioned off along the outskirts of the floor each tabletop bearing individual character nameplates. a packed house seats about 20 and it was as packed as it could get. guests are amiably greeted by a very accommodating host who is stationed at a counter that doubles as the ticket officemakeshift bar near the entrance. refreshments and cookies keep insulin levels high while patrons nibble and socialize at their tables. the layout needs more polishing perhaps a lone candle for the cabaret intentioned tablescape. the only prop ers are twin futons wrapped in florescent green fabric positioned at opposite ends of center stage. signaling the start of the play is an explosion of music ushering in a dancing troop of revelers clad in mardi gras masks and sequins. they gyrate and twirl whistle and shout to tunes that may have been on loan from arthur murrays mambo collection. the volume is too loud and the merrymaking in an effort to lighten up the crowd produces the opposite reaction when the actors start pulling audience members up to join the dance. this is the first painful crack against the fourth wall. interactive performances are pleasant enough but the old turn around the room with your p.o.w. is no longer kosher. its just awkward. so when one is forced to watch a hostage crisis unfolding onstage it certainly does not encourage the relax and enjoy the show maxim. the lady at our table mumbled an oh god before she was plucked up and away from the traitor arms of her laughing boyfriend. rest assured they gave her back to us eventually. shipwrecked twins  erwin tuazon and  lovelle liquigan perform an interpretive underwater dance. for those familiar with the plot this moment is admirable handling of the siblings separation however the abrupt shift in mood from partying to pantomime may confuse a first nighter. duke  played by chris greenwood picks up where the dance party leaves off and rushes into his famous soliloquy about music food and love as an address to the audience. despite his commanding stature and baritone greenwoods delivery lacks power due to his constant pacing about. its difficult to keep up with those beautiful lines because theyre never given enough time to permeate the air without being blown askew by greenwoods incessant movements. erika godwins  is a highlight. she glides in with servant  christine terrisse in tow and is at first striking in appearance with her raven hair and sharp features. godwins mourning ensemble is a black laced bodice with flowing skirts of tulle and an odd looking gold train of fabric pinned to her back. hand her a whip and the audience would have no problem submitting to this shrill and wily . zack price and jake brown play the terrible troublesome twosome of sir  belch and sir  aguecheek respectively. price plays drunk and sloppy quite comfortably maybe because hes had a few notches on his belch as sir  in past productions. browns sir  is hyper a departure from the texts slow tongued aguecheek and just seems to be running on a lot of coffee. these two conspire with the busty temptress  terrisse to bring down s steward  played by max smythe. with a slithering voice and a presence that can induce a cold sweat smythe is the outcast at which you uncomfortably laugh. this subplot can either be comedic or melancholic here it seems to be dangerously split down the middle.  sir  and  hold the comedic foil for a good run but the mood shifts to the dramatic during s imprisonment. as the fallen steward grows desperate  the clown spritely played by caryn crye takes pleasure in taunting him. and yet equal parts comedy and drama are not cohesive enough to balance the weak romance in this production. despite liquigans poignant portrayal of  the chemistry is lacking between her character and greenwoods . textually speaking twelfth night is easy to navigate through but there are instances during this performance where the text is simply lost. rhyme and meter are ignored lines are spoken too hastily and bleed into others the music doesnt fade out in time for the audience to catch the words and facial expressions overpower what is probably feared to be dead air. the start up years of a theater company are rough and unforgiving and first impressions bear the brunt of shrewd public opinion. this is  youre playing with. last metro company is no exception. they know this and are brave anyway. twelfth night or perhaps applicable here is the more befitting alternate title of what you will is celebrated for its multiplicity of characters and accessibility. last metro company is not so different. it is a non profit theater where founders play actors actors play costume designers costume designers play make up artists and make up artists play set designers. notwithstanding the limitations maybe this is the perfect inaugural performance for lmcs zany troupe of actors. they are a multiplicity of friends who want to nourish their passions and do away with the politics. they even plastered their own party masks and now im thinking they probably could care less about this review so do with it what you will right? ,2,Comedy,Negative
Twelfth Night,Malvolio Offers Hope to HSF's Twelfth Night,Cynthia Greenwood,twelfth nights ingenious balance of comedy and melancholy poses a perennial challenge for  directors. when robert hupp artistic director of arkansas repertory mused about this with me a couple of years ago he noted that directors must choose to play up the dramas low comedy or its darker element evoked by scenes involving sir  belch and companys malicious ridicule of . in pondering whether they should emphasize the romantic tale of  and the duke or the comic subplot of the debauched sir  hupp says directors must ask themselves are we going to urge the audience to laugh at  or feel sad for him? aided by a semi stroke of brilliant casting director sidney berger encourages viewers to empathize with s social climbing steward during the houston  festivals fourth staging of twelfth night since 1975. berger and his creative team present a colorful quasi neoclassical rendition of this mature comedy mostly uncluttered by contemporary deviations from s script. in part because of their strong execution of the riotous subplot the love triangle involving   and  flounders and then falls flat as all identities are revealed. a failure to monitor the players microphones also weakened the show on opening night at least for those seated behind the first few rows. on many levels the action of twelfth night is driven by individual fantasies and attempts at wish fulfillment hence the plays alternate title what you will an opaque phrase whose original meaning translates as what you wish. stranded by a shipwreck  s cross dressing heroine injects lively romance into the desultory lives of the mourning countess  and sentiment filled  the duke of illyria. when  enters the dukes life disguised as a young page named   sees his chance to seduce  using  as his messenger medium. posing as a boy the actor playing  must seem plausible as a woman distraught by loss and separation a surrogate wooer of  on her new masters behalf and an object of the dukes growing affection in scenes dripping with sexual irony. during the hsf production jennifer cherrys impersonation of  fails to meet the inherent challenges of this demanding role. convincingly costumed she is mildly entertaining as she woos  by proxy but during her repartee with duke  she comes across as ham handed neglecting many nuances in the verse. playing  ilich guardiola seems stiff and uneven beginning with the plays familiar opening lines if music be the food of love play on give me excess of it. cherry and other cast members are occasionally guilty of excessive mugging amateurish gesturing and gratuitous movement. their nervous energy detracts from what their lines are supposed to communicate. celeste roberts as  occasionally overplays but offers a striking presence onstage. clad in provocative brown velvet tucked into a full length gold skirt she is a beguiling man chaser. david walds vision of the sardonic  s wise fool feels tentative. the decision to have  vigorously strum his guitar in the style of a busker begging in a new york subway clashes with the formal pre 20th century effect of  sniders costume design. bergers directing of the subplot has a light touch building toward a climactic scene that evokes more empathy for the ambitious servant than the derision elicited by other directors. overall the story of how  up ends the hollow lives of illyrias mismatched aristocrats is overshadowed by the virtuoso performance of paul hope as .  a name whose latin roots mean ill wish or ill will is nearly undone when he dares to wish to marry his mistress and improve his social position. using deft understatement in early scenes hope presents  as by turns obedient toward  imperious toward sir  and company blithely opportunistic and sympathetically forlorn. kate revnell smith as  s woman in waiting shows complete command duping the ambitious steward with impressive aplomb. the actors playing sir  and company are a delightful complement to the superlative touch of hope and revnell smith. skilled comic actor rutherford cravens offers a slurring edgy sir  belch who nurses a whisky flask in several sight gags. in the shows first half guy roberts sir  aguecheek is funny as belchs drinking companion but in the shows second half he comes across as overly foppish. having him wear pigtails after the intermission is over the top considering that he courts  himself. caleb george as s servant  is pleasingly animated. ingenious choreography enhances the suspense when  mistakes a letter in s hand for a romantic overture by . eavesdropping on the steward sir  sir  and  dart in and out of the arches of a loggia situated stage right. reading the forged letter hope is engagingly gullible while the others gleefully look on. jonathan middents scenic design especially during this boffo scene is a pleasure to behold. middents later idea to imprison  in the base of a classical statue is also well conceived. over the centuries the hilarious antics of  and sir  in their plot to trick  have always threatened to steal this show. the threat at hsf is that without this comic relief their current production of twelfth night would be far less satisfying.,4,Comedy,Positive
Twelfth Night,Twelfth Night with Bob Dylan at the Helm,Denise Battista,director lesley currier offers a prologue to her production of twelfth night or all you need is love.  if youre a  purist please come to our production of   in august. purist or not marin  companys adaptation of twelfth night is one heck of a lot of fun but read a quick synopsis of the play before you go. think great music and lots of it and be prepared to hear your neighbors singing along and taking trips down memory lane during intermission. popular tunes from the late 50s through the 70s accompany this plays mistaken identities love triangles trickery and comedy and we all know the words to some of these tunes if not all. theres jackie wilson the beatles ben e. king donovan carly simon and sonny and cher just to name a few. theres also some standout dylan sung and strummed by lucas mcclure who is this plays . mcclure is like a character within a character. a poet within a poet. both his speaking voice and singing voice carry the cadence of dylan but theres also a slight and bizarre bit of george w. fingernails on a chalkboard in there perhaps to account for the part of the fool. whether in wig or shades or stepping out in pink flamingo slippers? mcclure and his guitar are show stealers. aside from mcclures actual singing and playing the musical part of this show is kind of a mix between karaoke and lip syncing depending whos doing the singing. it initially seems a bit forced and the scale tips confusedly back and forth between play and musical. one also wishes the actors would either sing a little louder as they accompany the tunes or just forget the vocals altogether and mouth the words. as it is they linger somewhere in between and their execution or perhaps elocution is not always harmonious. but the actors soon find their key and the music soon begins to complement s language very well. cat thompson who plays a sexy and sultry  in this production is the first and best at finding the right balance. thompson seems to accept the fact that she is an actor and not a singer and in response to this epiphany she turns her moments of song into an asides mixed with a bit of jim carey. one moment thompsons in the realm of the play and with a pronounced turn of the head she enters the realm of the musical. she just as smoothly reverts back to her character and the whole process equates to something quite funny and workable.  the rest of the cast for the most part follows suit and soon enough this musical adaptation finds its stride.  robinsons set design consists of a somewhat awkward stone castle façade perhaps part of a different set? decorated with not so awkward large cutouts of flowers peace signs and buddhist symbols and enlightened by a couple of lava lamps. theres a throwback chaise on which unrequited lovers may lament and linger fondle and massage and a drum set on which  beats out his broken heart. a tie dyed bbq and beer cooler sit stage left and encourage sir  to belch. in a recent interview lesley currier told me that robert currier has been preparing his whole life for this role. robert monopolizes on his characters last name and brings belch to life in the guise of willie nelson. the result is one vulgarly charming rough and stumble drunk who speaks from the gut. the boyishly handsome heartthrob alex curtis had his moments of ups and downs on opening night. curtis who plays s twin  emerges from s bedchamber presumably after some offstage frolicking with the duchess. with a smile on his face he comes skipping down the stairs and with a spin and a leap topples off the stage and into the audience. we paused in an eternal moment of bated breath until curtis popped up and sprayed us with a slew of hershey kisses. whoever said love hurts really wasnt kidding props to curtis for his leap back up on the stage and for going on with the show. abra bermans costume design is a colorful palate of hippie brilliance from the lamentable duke s  elsman array of silken sergeant pepper suits to the panache of the hot pink feathers pluming from the dukes shiny back up singers the s. i cant quite figure out these pink singers but ill just say that theyre cute and they make a good entourage. robert currier looks like he raided willie nelsons closet and everyone else wears their fringe and bellbottoms headbands and yellow cross laced boots with a difference. its so important for the role of  to strike just the right chord incorporating comedy that deserves a laugh as well as wit intellect and charisma that leads both man and woman to fall in love with this woman dressed as a man. alexandra matthew strikes that chord primarily with her ability to embrace and release s language to not overplay her role as a woman acting like a man and finally with the look on her face as she prepares for her masculine role by stuffing a sock down her pants. cynthia pepper does a great job choreographing a ridiculously silly golf club duel between matthew as  and camilla ford sir  aguecheek with clubs whirling in the air and loony music to keep up the pace. jack powell as  also strikes a perfect chord in this production. powell has this uncanny ability to defy gravity with his face. he initially offers his character a bit of ocd with his seeming need to only walk a path of right angles. hes heartwarming when he forces his face to crack a smile and heartbreaking when shackled and imprisoned by sir   and  shannon veon kase. my favorite powellism however is the walk he incurs after reading the dreaded fake note left for him as a trap. powell conjures the mynah bird from the 1943 merrie melodies cartoon inki and the mynah bird or perhaps it is his own version of monty pythons ministry of silly walks. nonetheless powell plays  with all the melancholy and madness this character deserves. comedy is in abundance throughout this production from potty humor to wit akin to . ford is hysterical as a revenge of the geeks aguecheek and does the best darn funky chicken seen on a an stage. interactions between  steve budd and  are timed well enough to be a saturday night live skit back when saturday night live was good and while budd puts himself into casual flex poses in hopes that his love interest will take notice lesley curriers direction picks up on every possible homoerotic pun and gives the actors full freedom to run with it. terry rucker majorly nails two minor roles as the sea captain complete with back up singer sailors and as a cross eyed sri yogi who embraces the movement of hippieism to zen buddhism in the 1960s and 70s with the wheel of dharma in his hands. ruckers stereotypical sea captain seems reminiscent to  mccallister from the episode of the simpsons conveniently called the sea captain. yarr while i consider myself a bit of a  purist sometimes an angle sets you straight especially when its right on.  sometimes its fun to just go with the flow get on your groove and be mellow yellow. this production is festive it doesnt forget that  wrote the play and it celebrates the twenty years of fun both lesley and robert currier have been having at the marin  company.  how can you not love a little dylan under the stars especially to the fine artistic tuning of ?

shirt that is really unbuttoned down to his bellybutton. the sight lends itself to laughter. the most elegantly dressed is of course katie macnichol in tailored dresses that emphasize her slender frame and tiny waist. for s wedding macnichol adorns herself in a couture style white strapless dress with a sheath overlay adding texture to the bodice and fullness to its peek a boo open skirt. a fringed sash perfects the ensemble with a splash of elegance. paul mullins direction gracefully meshes characters costumes music and set design inspired by an illusionary seacoast. mullins festively follows tradition at the old globe by meshing the actors with the audience using the full scope of the theatre as the actors tear through the crowd and at times engage those seated in the front row. christopher r. walkers sound design and 50s inspired music is also great fun. newcombs songs along with some impressive harmonizing on the part of s court draw the audience further into the festive nature of this play. the lowell davies festival theatre is one of three old globe stages. the woodwork of the permanent stage is brilliant somehow escaping the wear and tear of an open air theatre. the stage has so many tricks in its wings that it looks like it could break down into a transformer. up and center is a hidden sliding door that provides passage for boats. with just a hint of light the skyfare can be seen working at the san diego zoo. the skyfare is an air rail that gives zoo visitors a view of balboa park and the old globe theatres. the stage has three entrances that are exchanged andor used as per the production at hand. ralph funicellos scenic design includes umbrellas and a lounge chair for  a docking area with crates and fishing nets for  and wood pillars as props for sir  sir  and . since the lowell davies festival theatre is outdoors sweaters and blankets are wise accoutrements for those foggy nights. also the fifteen minute intermission feels like five so preorder your snacks before the show from the pub which offers the best brownie in san diego made by le chef. if music be the food of love play on  and eat brownies.,4,Comedy,Positive
Twelfth Night,An Enchanting Illyrian Summer in New York,Roseanne Wells,every year new yorkers flock to the delacorte theater for  in the park the public theaters free summer series in central parks outdoor amphitheater. this years  offering is twelfth night and the dedicated theatergoers will not be disappointed. daniel sullivans star studded production is articulate seam splittingly hilarious and genuinely intimate. sullivan has gathered a very skilled group of designers to create a smooth production that seems effortless. as the production begins at dusk  kaczorowskis subtle lighting gently washes over the stage perfectly blending with the fading sunlight as night slips in.  lee beattys scenic design is enchantingly subtle an artistic interpretation of the sculpted park outside of the walls. hills with grass covered stairs and little shelves that serve as seating give the set dimension and functionality. on tall saplings hang little lanterns to create a thin forest for lovers chasing drunkards frolicking and persons transforming. jane greenwoods costume design seems to have a victorian sentiment about it but there is no clear time period making the magic universal rather than chronological. brooklyn bred folk rock band hem composed the live music that adds a touch of sweet quaintness that is also reably catchy. the play opens with musicians drifting in while  audra mcdonald picks flowers but not even the serenaders sent by  raúl esparza to woo her will sway this hardhearted mourning countess. poor  esparza is a poet whose muse spurns him which only encourages his pursuit moodiness and gestures of love. in a muted gray jacket with tails cream pants and black boots esparza is noble but dogged in his humbling degrading devotion to the countess. interestingly his most genuine expression of love is not even shown to . when  sings for the court the duke mouths the words then harmonizes to the melancholic folksy tune. when  disguised as  begins to sing she is equally as struck by the force of her emotions. the duke recognizes his serving man as a compatriot in loves sickness also ensnared by loves trap but he is oblivious to the obvious. of course we are in on s anne hathaway secret having seen hathaway recover from one very clever shipwreck. wet and barefoot from the storm hathaway is soaked in white undergarments and corset clutching a blanket for modesty and comfort. she looks out at the audience with wonder and grief and we are captivated to the end. as  hathaway is poised quick thinking and well spoken. her  is all of these things but we can also see his character develop as  falls in love and transforms within his skin. when dressed as a man hathaway is energetic spontaneous and emotional.  has good reason to call  saucy and peevish because he truly is but endearing and unwittingly charming as well and  falls hard for this man who is actually a woman. in their first major scene mcdonald and hathaway have great repartee speaking the verse with fresh energy and clarity. the willow cabin monologue is bubbling with such emotion that it verges on coherent babble overwhelming hathaway to the point of tears that are hastily hidden. mcdonald tries to remain in control but finds accidental flirting more fun than mourning. as the play continues she becomes an impulsive minx eager to cast off her oppressive wintry thoughts for sexier spring ambition. but the play is not all moping and sighing over love.  julie white and  jay o. sanders laugh at love and its physical nature they are also quite cuddly and loving in this production which is unusual but very charming. sanderss  also shows admiration for s scheming against  indicating he loves her for her brains and body. sullivans production certainly includes the bawdy humor that is ripe in twelfth night but the physical comedy surpasses the punny one liners to stomach hurting status. each actor holds his own with the physicality and timing but if there is a leader here it would have to be hamish linklater as sir . dressed in a green hat with a yellow feather yellow striped shirt and mustard pants he is too foolish and really naïve to be s proper suitor. as the hotheaded coward linklater makes his first entrance with bumbling earnestness only to knock over an urn kicking ashes everywhere in a very steve urkel moment. and it only gets funnier. david pittu chooses to play  with more melancholy than humor though he does play word games around  and the others. he is dressed similarly to sir  in a foppish hat and crazy patterns but his artful command of language makes him witty not foolish. with his dower disposition comes wisdom and a nice singing voice perfect for the hems folksy arrangements. michael cumpsty also brings singular nuances to  like playing up his marriage fantasy gaining an opulent lifestyle lording rights over sir  and ravishing  on a regular basis. not sounding so puritan is he? perhaps because of this emphasis or sullivans avoidance of a blighting incident for the happy couples at the finale s ending is less tragic and more feeble and pitiful. in the other subplot  is dressed as a pirate complete with a bandana 3 pointed hat earring ruffled shirt and pirate boots but his flamboyancy is more adventurer than romantically interested in . he seems to be in illyria on a lark with a novice under his wing rather than endangering himself for his unrequited love.  stark sands is an excellent match for  in looks and in character. the twins mourn for each other as though they have truly lost a part of themselves. when they are reunited they are part of the finale but they are also sharing twin secrets with a simple whisper or glance. this wonderful production ends with song and dance laughter tinged with sadness and even though everybody in new york city will be clamoring for a ticket its worth the wait.,5,Comedy,Positive
Twelfth Night,Twelfth Night with Funny Bones But No Guts,Roseanne Wells,the pearl theatre company is well known for its commitment to classical theater and its repertory company of actors. twelfth night starts their 25th anniversary season but the production isnt quite as captivating as hoped.the stage is laid out with a magenta royal entrance with golden chandeliers for  set stage left contrasting with the more subdued striped and latticed courtyard stage right. though s garden does have an oval pool s balcony seems to jut out over the ocean painted on the backdrop. michael gabriel goodfriend as  wonderfully incorporates the illusionary outdoor setting looking over the sea from time to time as if he would have to challenge its vast and dangerous waters to win s heart. in his gold and white striped tunic goodfriend looks like a majestic caliph touched with poetic melancholy and self obsession that stems not from arrogance but from obliviousness to his surroundings so absorbed with loving . the lady of his eye however dresses in a long sleeved black dress with lace veil to deny his unmitigated advances as well as mourn her recent losses. rachel botchan plays  dignified and close to the vest maintaining an exterior of honest confidence revealing no real distain for  or attraction to  to begin. but she is not made of stone she wipes tears from her cheeks after s first exit acts giddily in confidence with the audience and eventually changes her costume palette from a harsh black to a soft feminine pink. and although botchan and ali ahn as  share a lengthy full mouthed kiss in the ending scene it is not enough to revive this .ahn plays  as if it was an acting exercise or a dry run before an audition. she breezes through the make me a willow cabin at your gate monologue like she is late for an appointment and i left no ring with her feels predictable and recycled. from her first moments with the sea captain her character lacks genuine response. ahn acts  rather than embodying her.  has no cutting wit like beatrice no stubborn audacity like isabella no supernatural regality like . these characters as well as other female roles in s canon can stand on a noticeable trait. but  isnt even supported by a temporary melancholic disposition like . imbuing  with passion and vivacious emotion is what lifts her from page to stage. without the actress and her human experience  is reduced to lifeless rigidity. can also be a difficult role because there is so much material for farce that it can mask his humanity. dominic cuskern plays this droll role deftly with victorian stiffness in a knee length archaic suit jacket. when he enters the drunken scene in burgundy robe and white nightcap it is painfully clear how antiquated he is. cuskern also highlights a transformation within  he doesnt end as the puritan who started the play for desire of s wealth and wanted revenge on the tricksters have shaped his nature differently. he is lost between his previous ability to elevate himself through behavior if not through bought or inherited social status and the floodgates of emotion and vice have recently opened. we never know where he concludes since there is no revenge play for the puritan steward.bradford covers sir  has a wonderfully strong sense of entitlement paired with casual negligence and wide eyes for sir s purse not his person.  played by david l. townsend is earnestly foolish in a soft yellow striped jacket bowtie and flat topped straw hat like dick van dyke in the fantasy scene from mary poppins. perfectly sincere and gullible he is an easy target for sir . sean mcnall takes a fine turn as  but i do wish that older actors would be considered more often for this apparently foolish knave who holds the wisdom of the world in his pocket yet is sprightly enough to win smiles. tj edwards as  almost upstages   and  with his guest role in the drunk scene his excellent drunkenness unencumbered by lines or attempted wit.  joseph midyett and  jay stratton get a little washed over not taking stage presence until  succumbs to  and he meets  again during the ending revelation scene. scenes involving   and the rogues in combination s discovery of the letter when he displays his yellow cross gartered stockings the attempted duel are glowing. however while the crazy antics of the men acting like boys are funny and amusing they dont really take advantage of the text which is littered with bawdy references that in this case are merely glazed over. there is no power behind the action just gestures and shadows of potential ribbing. most impressive however is the well executed moment during which  comes before  to gain retribution and only receives a halfhearted apology. crushed as though she literally steps on his chest his threat of vengeance is only an afterthought. cuskern underscores the scene with dynamic emotion. with power like that carried throughout this production would be a smash hit.,3,Comedy,Negative
Twelfth Night,Decide What You Will in West End’s Twelfth Night,Claudine Nightingale,this season at londons donmar west end is impressive to say the least. their current production of twelfth night follows the critically acclaimed ivanov starring kenneth branagh and precedes me de sade and  with big names like judi dench and jude law among the cast lists. this production of twelfth night is far from being cast in the seasonal shadows. with original costuming and stark stunning sets director michael grandage and his actors including none other than derek jacobi create a successful atmosphere of ambiguity in a play based upon that very concept.the complete title of the play twelfth night or what you will has little to do with the action of the story and seems to suggest that  didnt care enough about his work to give it a suitable title. this flippancy is perhaps the reason for the sometimes ridiculous and often silly plot twists one encounters in the play. despite these twists and turns the cast successfully imparts humor throughout. victoria hamilton as  the shipwrecked lady forced to make her way in the world dressed as a eunuch carries herself so well in her disguise as  that while she appears as a boy to all on stage the audience never forgets her true sex and finds it easy to laugh at her increasingly difficult situation.  bonnar as  the lovesick duke of illyria while often hard to hear is funny in his ridiculousness spending the entire first half of the production in his night clothes pining after a woman who will never love him. said woman  played by the stunning indira varma is witty cruel and silly all at once able to refuse with one breath the repeated advances of the duke while with the other fall madly in love with his messenger a person so obviously not a man as to be laughable.  the real powerhouse performances however come from the comedic grouping of  and his drunken witty and oftentimes foolish antagonists  sir  belch sir  aguecheek and  samantha spiro ron cook guy henry and zubin varma respectively.  derek jacobi the most famous and decorated actor among the cast offers a stellar rendition of  the sullen and pompous house steward reduced to foolishness by the cruel trick played on him by the house guests and servants he is set to manage. when jacobi appears onstage in a captains hat blue blazer white shorts and yellow socks complete with garters the audience can do nothing but laugh at the scene. the same is true for the performances of   and . spiro cook and henry throw wit around as if it were confetti and it is their combined performance that reminds the audience that this is indeed a an comedy full of vinegar and pepper.it is not the acting however that most distinguishes this performance what makes this production stand out is its costumes lighting and set design. fizz jones as costume supervisor chose not to set the play in any one time period opting instead to have characters change from elizabethan garb at one point to 1930s beachwear at another.  demonstrates this when she first appears onstage in an incredible black mourning dress complete with bustle and full veil and is next seen in white sailor pants and oxfords looking very much like a young katharine hepburn. the artistic ramifications of this ambiguity of dress link to the ambiguity of the plays title in changing the characters dress to random samplings of historical costume the creative directors are allowing the audience to take what it will from the production instead of imposing a certain way of seeing the work. the same can be said for set and lighting design. christopher oram and neil austin combine their talents to create a stark sparse set notable only for the play of light and shadow across the stage. it is this visual interplay that offers the audience an array of perspectives. at one moment  frozen in shadow sits on her couch pining away for  while on another part of the stage  presents s ring to . this sort of staging and lighting which shines throughout the production provides alternate realities on one well defined curtainless stage. outdoor scenes are ed by the brightness of the white backdrop and the sounds of the sea in contrast to the darkness of s underground prison setting the tone for the comedic and the not so comedic moments in this production.there are dark moments in this work particularly regarding the treatment of  by his tormentors. jacobi does a fantastic job of keeping what little dignity is left to his character after becoming the victim of entrapment and false imprisonment. vowing revenge on the whole pack of them he leaves the stage with all the pomp and circumstance a broken man can muster. it is not a scene to be laughed at and the audience realizes this. even though  and  get away with their trick and even though the love knot of   and  is appropriately untangled one is left with the sense that something funny went on here. this feeling is evident when one reads the play and the trick is to impart this to an audience. grandage and his cast accomplish this and leave us with the decision to make what we will from the story. happy ending?  perhaps. or perhaps the ending is flawed with the malice of a joke gone too far. it is ultimately for us to decide what we will.,4,Comedy,Positive
Twelfth Night,"If Music Be the Food of Love, Rock On",Matthew Barbot,its expected these days to update  productions either to prove the bards continuing relevance andor to attract new younger audiences. but too often the new settings are just gimmicks setting  and  in los angeles or  in the sixties or deciding that  from the merchant of venice is a stockbroker are all just arbitrary unless they are somehow meaningfully connected to the text. if directors want to find ways to successfully keep  hip they should take a cue from new york neo classical ensembles most recent show which actually deigned to not just transpose a modern setting onto the text but rather to develop it into a fully fleshed out production concept. of all of s comedies twelfth night is the one in which music plays the largest role   in fact the plays first spoken line refers to musics emotional power. nyneos choice then to set the play in a youth culture largely defined by its music succeeds in ways many  updates do not.in director stephen stouts delightful production the food of love is indie rock. the original score by matthew roi berger who also plays sir  in this production uses s lyrics and is so good so authentic and so well incorporated into the shows hipster vibe that its easy to feel the music is being performed by a band so cool no ones even heard of them yet. from this base the rest of the production comes naturally. jessica pabsts costume design is dominated by skinny jeans and converse line delivery is snarky and modern my one complaint here is that the verse is often ignored and the characterizations all take their cues from personages familiar to anyone whos ever lived in a trendy neighborhood.the setting also manages to dictate which issues the show is able to tackle it only makes sense after all that a play that uses cross dressing as a major plot device should explore the politics of sex and sexuality. there is no attempt to preserve the original meaning of s lofty praise and proclamations of love and adoration in this production he is in love with  which only serves to heighten his perceived betrayal in illyria.  the fool is another gay character and he often uses his aggressive sexuality to keep other characters on their toes. his method of discovering that duke s servant is in fact two different people is more than a bit hands on. perhaps most interestingly though this production addresses the problem of  and s relationship in order for s love of  to be credible at the end of the play there has to be some sort of attraction early on even when  is disguised as a man. in a wonderfully directed and beautifully acted scene the disguised  sits with  listening to s band jam. its agonizing the attraction between  and the very confused duke crackles as they rough house and when the inevitable kiss finally comes it explodes with all the complicated emotion involved on both sides. the scene also succeeds in making  a much more likeable character and in making the plays resolution much more enjoyable.there is also the question of those characters that inevitably end up alone. in the play sir  aguecheek is not really reprehensible just stupid  is abused beyond any reasonable bounds of practical joking far out of proportion to any offense hes committed and its all just laughed off. this productions  is faithful true and has proven himself many a time to a  that seems at times to lead him on. each of these characters pursues love and the promise of being loved in return only to wind up with zilch. stouts production neither waves them off nor accepts that these characters just stop appearing in the script. in the elaborate dance number that closes the show yes you read that correctly   and  wander about alone together put off by the couples insensitive antics.  too winds up alone but in the end when he is entreated to go and make peace with  who has just sworn revenge he does nothing but watch the man leave implying that deep down perhaps the fool has more in common with  than he lets on. these discussions lend the thematic depth needed to earn the colorful silliness of the rest of the production.ne donly is a lot of fun to watch as  as shes managed to take the production concept to heart and run with it. one gets the sense that shes unafraid to take chances on stage to really play which makes her funnier moments sparkle with energy and her more heartfelt or anguished moments which she also plays well all the more painful. her counterpart richard douglass is able to capture a real innocence and clear eyed goodness in  that helps us to get to know and like him despite the fact that he has significantly less stage time than his sister. when he finally gets to town and begins to be mistaken for his disguised twin sister douglass gets laughs from just the wordless expressions of confusion and stupefaction his character displays as he tries to understand whats going on around him when  inexplicably seeks his love and his body he has no idea whats going on but whats so funny is that he doesnt much care.robbie collier subletts  is simmering and brooding but he should perhaps be advised that speaking the verse rapidly is not the same as expressing the verse effectively in fact it often makes him more difficult to understand. the team of matthew roi berger  belch cale krise  aguecheek and daliya karnofsky  is loud vulgar and hilarious but perhaps the most interesting aspect of their scenes are bergers explorations of s darker side when he rails against  bill griffin we learn more about his character than we do perhaps about any of his cohorts and both he and stout deserve a lot of credit for their willingness to go there in one of s more unmitigated comedies.as is so often the case however the fool steals the show brandon uranowitz effortless command of the language and again his willingness to explore his characters depth makes him absolutely spellbinding. it helps of course that he sings most of the shows songs.nyneos twelfth night is far from traditional but it takes risks that pay off. every choice is interesting and intelligent derived from the text and a good concept and not merely from a compulsion to update . and those new young audiences? i saw the show on a saturday night and the theater was completely packed primarily by lively enthusiastic people under thirty. as i was leaving the theatre i heard a girl who couldnt have been older than ten say to her mother that was amazing that was the best show ever can we come see it again? praise doesnt come much higher than that.,4,Comedy,Positive
Twelfth Night,Prague Shakespeare Heightens the Antic Side of Twelfth Night,Cynthia Greenwood,a new staging of twelfth night co produced by the prague  company and houstons main street theatre seems to sidestep the challenges presented by s elegant balance of comedy and melancholy by dwelling on the comic subplot that features sir  belch. sir  s inebriated impecunious knight has more lines than any other character in this play so his role has the potential to co opt the plays dark exploration of the cruel plot perpetrated against . in director rebecca greene uddens version of s final elizabethan comedy sir  belchs drinking frolicking and belching is so extreme that it even involves the audience on several occasions. her emphasis is in line with the plays association with english pre lenten celebration that involved eating songs dance masques and general misrule that elizabethan audiences would have indulged in on the eve of january 6th or twelfth night the feast of the epiphany. melissa carsons costume designs are especially elegant and striking in this co production. the plays central plot revolves around  the twin sister of  who is washed up on the shores of illyria and forced to assume the male persona of  and serve as a page in the court of duke . the duke is infatuated with the eligible but distant  a grief stricken countess who cant get past the need to mourn her recently deceased father and brother. both  who is more in love with the idea of love and  guilty of an excess of grief are jolted into reality when  comes into the picture.  enlists  to woo  on his behalf but the plan quickly goes awry when  falls for the young page. actor jessica boone who is well cast as the young androgynous  deftly and subtly woos  on s behalf especially in the plays first half. playing   frederick secrease comes across well as the idle aristocrat lacking in self knowledge and fixated on his unrequited love. within the love triangle actor jan thompson who besides acting serves as the british ambassador to the czech republic is most convincing as the quiet aristocrat resigned to give over her life and her youth to a life of mourning. complicating the main plot is s riotous uncle sir  belch a knight whose fortunes are at a low point forcing him to live off of his richer kinswoman. he presides over his own court of sycophants including  s gentlewoman sir  aguecheek his drinking companion and  s gentleman. we might associate sir  with the good and the bad of unbridled indulgence in the pre lenten season. by contrast  s lead servant and a paragon of abstinence disapproves of the merrymaking of sir  and his lot. tiring of s pompous ways  forges a letter ostensibly written by  and dupes the steward into believing that her mistress has designs on him. actor guy roberts transforms sir  belch into a cavorting and gamboling buffoon who hides flasks of drink in every imaginable crevice on his body and his kinswomans house even filching a bottle of beer that belonged to a bemused spectator during thursday nights performance. carrying out s practical joke actor bree welch offers a cleverly understated counterpoint to roberts overly raucous interpretation. as the preening squire sir  aguecheek the blond wigged jay deyonker offers the best visual portrait of this legendary fop that ive ever seen. jonathan teverbaughs delightful vision of  is very sensitive to the nuances of s verse. playing  bill roberts offers a convincing portrait of the unpopular puritan in a household of revelers.  hoskings performance as  is solid and satisfying but on occasion his verse was difficult to follow. the love and lunacy found in s earlier mature comedies such as a midsummer nights dream and much ado about nothing are not punctuated by the dark realism that permeates twelfth night. the prague  companymain street theatre co production pays excessive attention to the plays lords of misrule drawing our attention away from s equally important focus on the awakening or spiritual unmasking of  and  two aristocrats who are self deluded at the outset as well as the gravity of the cruel joke perpetrated against a social climbing steward who styles himself as a corrective to the excess of sir  belchs court.,4,Comedy,Positive
Twelfth Night,A Twelfth Night for Today's Gender Bending Times,Diana Louise Carter, in delaware parks choice to mount an all male production of twelfth night is billed as an homage to tradition for the companys 40th anniversary season in buffalo ny. this gender bending play however is perfect for today what with recent historic events and ongoing discussions of gay and trans rights. whatever the backdrop though this production directed by steve vaughn is a delight. between the laughs over the antics of the many fools and the awkwardness that arises when a male actor plays a woman masquerading as a man who falls in love with another man the audience ends up doing a lot of thinking. thats especially so when two male actors lock lips for lingering kisses as they do again and again. the men playing female roles play them straight   that is they dont do over the top drag but act earnestly as women kudos to wig designer mary mcmahon jakiel whose realistic work made the actors jobs a little easier. only occasionally does sdp favorite tim newell wink at the audience as he plays the countess  emerging from familial grief to become a love sick kitten trying to snag her claws on . when newell picks up his skirts to run off stage its with perfect elizabethan feminine delicacy.  his sigh of delight and lust when he first sees the man hes been chasing and the man hes married are two people is hilarious. likewise  yellens  servant to  is perfectly wench like. hes saucy and able to suffer and rise above the fools in the play without losing feminine sensibilities. and then we have  the female half of a co ed pair of twins who makes her way in a strange land by dressing as a young man. upon first sight actor jordan louis fischer is a credible woman with flowing blond hair. as  pretending to be  though its as if the character becomes an overtly gay man losing the some of the complex layers of gender identity. s job is to woo  on behalf of his master  chris hatch which is quite complicated since  falls for the messenger and  has fallen completely for . fischer is best in the cat and mouse game with newell always delicately trying to plead his masters case while eluding the subject of his masters ardor. when his  is tense she clamps her knees together then remembers to spread them apart in a more manly way of sitting. it would be good to see  suffer more for his love and squirm more when he realizes hes growing overly attached to his male servant. but this is a minor flaw in a very enjoyable production. all the love intrigue becomes something of a subplot when the clowns are sent in.  theyre all too good to name a standout. the sheer number of fools in twelfth night makes it hard to tell them apart in some productions. not so here as the actors abilities their varied physiques and costuming signatures all make each distinct. take   gjurich s steward who is dressed with puritan severity that underscores his self rightious behavior. theres a wonderful scene when hes reading the ersatz letter  has written him as  suggesting he woo his employer. when  reads the instruction to smile more gjurich declares i will smile i will do everything that thou wilt have me with an intense grimace that passes for a smile. meanwhile sir  belch a spot on performance by the experienced norman sham sir  aguecheek played with great dimness and sympathy by david lundy and  justin dimieri bring to mind the three stooges as they creep behind him to eavesdrop only partly hidden by movable trees. when  starts to imagine how hell curtail s drunken exploits once he weds s niece it takes all of lundys and dimieris apparent strength to rein in the charging bear that  becomes for a moment. the scene builds to a dynamic and very funny crescendo carrying the audience into intermission with a chuckle. the portly sham portrays  as a falstaff with more gas jollity and cleverness. luncys aguecheek in a copious wig blue patterned coat and foreshadowing yellow cross gardered stockings is wonderfully overdressed for the party he always seems to be having in his head as a result of drinking too much. stephen wiskers  is a bit of a surprise on account of his leading man looks and height. hes a musical fool on top of being a wise and witty one. in fact the ensembles all male chorus is quite a treat sometimes acapella sometimes accompanied just by s guitar and other times by cello jay wollin and violin lucas denies. sound designer and composer tom makar comes through again with sprightly music that keeps the scene changes moving. costume designer ken shaw and his crew have done a reable job of fitting the attire to the characters so well that the audience sometimes loses sight of the costumes. on the other hand through identical golden outfits and blond wigs as well as casting that selected two actors with similar builds theres a moment when  pj tighe appears for the second time and it takes a few moments to realize this is  and not his twin. well done.,4,Comedy,Positive
Twelfth Night,Never Bring a Robot to a Fish Fight,Jennifer Kramer,for those interested in exploring gender dynamics   like the  theatre as per the mission statement of their ongoing ninth season   productions based on s twelfth night or what you will are an obvious choice. of these gender comedy a less stupid twelfth night gay fantasia is probably less obvious but this intriguing parody makes some bold claims about sexuality theatrical conventions s language and robots. playwright harry slack has moved the setting to modern day hylaria a land of restrictive social conventions existential ennui and meticulously regulated fish fights that is populated by broad though usually recognizable caricatures of the characters from twelfth night. the shipwrecked  lavinia loveless drag alter ego of josh hitchens tragically bereft of her parents and identical twin brother  takes the advice of a random drunk lady and dresses up like a man for lack of a better option. she ends up in the employment of the transparently closeted orson patrick lamborn who is seeking the hand of the grief  and boy? crazed socialite  dana krietz in marriage sight unseen also apparently for lack of a better option. s deadbeat uncle  fart harry slack and nihilistic bff andy lesley berkowitz briefly pause in their drinking to torment s devoted butler melvin lamborn with a cruel illusion of love in the form of the  bot. meanwhile a similarly shipwrecked  mercedes lyons cox wanders around the city in the company of the murderously devoted miss antonia krietz catching a one man show by the clown slack about a certain gender bending an comedy and extemporizing about semiotics deconstructivist theory and the enduring popularity of the bard   himself. despite the productions title   gender comedya less stupid twelfth night gay fantasia   it sometimes fails to make the case that it is either being sarcastic or genuinely less stupid. its plot is reably faithful to twelfth night and while twelfth night is no die hard as  so memorably puts it it seems safe to say that any play featuring the line if this were played upon a stage now i could condemn it as an improbable fiction is probably not intended to be taken completely seriously gender comedys habit of pointing out that an intentionally ridiculous plot is ridiculous is not in itself clever. and while gender comedy features genderqueering cross dressing and robosexual attraction in most cases it is merely making s subtext text. s gender confusion and experimentation along with  and s subsequent bewildered attraction are all present in twelfth night with gender comedy doing little to expand upon them besides making them explicit. cross dressing of course was a staple of elizabethan theater. furthermore by making  female gender comedy is actually less gay in some ways though both antonia and  are played by women antonias intense relationship with  is cast more in terms of an albeitly kind of creepy motherly connection instead of  and s homoerotic one. the robots are admittedly unique. part of the problem arises from the plays privileging of s command of language over his other abilities. this is praised while his plots are mocked his character work meanwhile is almost completely ignored.  though sassily played by loveless is identifiable by her name and cross dressing only her lines retaining little of the original characters quick wit charisma and constant occasionally hare brained scheming. while gender comedys other characters are more recognizable they are also greatly simplified severely limiting the productions ability to examine twelfth nights many complicated relationships   and by extension missing the point that the characters  created to deliver his soliloquies are equally important to the immortal words they utter. as a transformative work gender comedy is at its most interesting when it actively engages with twelfth night. s revelation late in the play that she is not a woman dressed up like her brother but actually is her brother not only ups the confusion and hilarity of the plays denouement but also highlights the performative nature of gender itself. it is left entirely ambiguous whether she has simply cracked under pressure or genuinely is  reclaiming his identity after previously cracking under pressure with the casting of both twins potentially undermining the theatrical conventions that accept an actors performed gender at face value. that this proves ultimately irrelevant to the plays happy ending is the result of another clever subversion of twelfth night. the absurdity of hylarias social norms is a running gag from the way no one comments on the presence of jeremy orsons everpresent cardboard cut outs of humphrey bogart and mixed martial artist thiago alves to the vital importance of a proper fish fight for every excellent fish slap the fighter receives a wallop bonus which results in triple deduction of penalty points to the ridiculous legal code where it is against the law to propose to your employer but no one is required to lock jail cell doors. the love polygon of  orson   is finally resolved by a new law from the desk of jacqueline beret and her pencil thin mustache making it legal to love whomever you want whereupon the characters throw away their inhibitions and appropriately pair off. its a deus ex machina ending that stands in stark contrast to the end of twelfth night where restrictive elizabethan social conventions are reasserted in the nominally happy ending despite the tension this creates gender comedy on the other hand is free to skewer the arbitrariness of its social conventions and then discard them completely pointing out that they too are merely a construct and not an immutable part of the natural order. the questioning of identities that gender comedy borrows from twelfth night is echoed by aetna gallaghers costume design the strength of each characters self delusion may be enough to convince their easily susceptible peers that their actions and dress are appropriate for their role but their true nature is easily visible to the audience.  wears a cravat with a ratty old bathrobe and s mourning attire is manid by a sparkly minidress and lacy tights. melvins top hat tails and cummerbund cannot class up his schoolboy shorts just as orsons waistcoat and deliberation over the perfect skinny jeans cannot make up for the fact that he never actually manages to keep on a pair of pants. s blazer and tie cannot conceal that she is still only wearing her heels garter belt and corset underneath. the audacious incongruence of the characters costumes works much better than the similarly lampshaded one dimensional representation of the characters themselves though the casts comedic skills enlivens an otherwise shallow reading of twelfth night. in a sock gartered tour de force patrick lamborn alternates between amusingly synthesizing as many gay stereotypes as possible for his performance as the self reportedly straight orson and portraying melvin as a sweet natured doormat in what is probably the most adorable rendition of  in the history of theater. lesley berkowitz gets perhaps the most original material briefly appearing as a drunk and the inexplicable jacqueline beret but primarily playing andy a composite of sir  aguecheek  and the depressive end of s mood swings her endless succession of bleak one liners fine ill just stay silent like god is delivered with enough dark energy to keep them increasingly hilarious just in time for her to abruptly switch to andys hopeless longing for innocence and love  from the fish in the fish fight. harry slack gives  fart a cheerful apathy and dana krietz shines as the  bot somehow imbuing a touching humanity into the perfectly mimicked vocal intonations of stephen hawkings speech synthesizer. director and set designer paul kuhn complements the casts antics with a thrust stage configuration festooned with brightly colored sheets of construction paper streamers and hanging light bulbs a simple yet effective set up. though the windows at the back of the stage are sadly underutilized the interlocking wooden pallets are cleverly used for the majority of the furniture providing chairs tables and fish fight barricades as needed. kuhns direction is similarly multi faceted expertly balancing the plays wordplay slapstick over the top characters and visual gags without taking attention away from the material. even when not up to the challenge of engaging with its progenitor gender comedy a less stupid twelfth night gay fantasia offers a snappy and colorful satire of sexual and social mores and helps in its own way to combat the tragic lack of robotic representation in the an canon. though a fish fight can only end in despair the  theatres production is screamingly funny right through its conclusion.,4,Comedy,Positive
Twelfth Night,"A Fair Show, a Less Fair ""Twelfth Night""",J. A. Macfarlane,twelfth night is a play of travels less so perhaps than pericles but the scansion between its scenes is still ed by voyages from the shipwreck that bereaves twins  and  of one another to  s endless missions to s house s mysterious appearance at s court and  and s arrival in illyria. even the second plot that of sir  and his accomplices is ed by the drunkards need to prevent sir  from voyaging. the separation between s court and s house is a basic fact of the play one that underlies the separation between characters and the possibility   or lack thereof   of communication between them. so it is manifest nonsense for director matthew gorman to set hart houses production of the play not only in a single set but a single set that is clearly a single location as well. it is a beautiful set with lovely pseudo tiffany windows well made solidly built and clearly impossible to move the interior of the elephant bar owned and run by  where all the characters of the play eventually congregate with the occasional help of textual rearrangement. this causes many problems which we will come to. also worrisome is the opening non an country song whose link to the play appears slight and before even that though recurring throughout and just as head scratching the pre show soundtrack of what i suspect is meant to be rain but sounds more like a permanently running toilet. the opening song does not even have the excuse of serving as a prelude to s first line for gorman makes the common decision to rearrange the first scene so that  may open the play rather than  which entirely alters the framework of the text. true we are given a song before  enters a country and western piece whose link to the play is rather dubious and that sets up the below stairs world of sir  and sir  rather than it does s court. in the text we have  sets up the world of illyria   that of the lovesick duke with a taste for clichéd metaphors   into which  erupts interrupting the natural course of the petrarchan plot. reversing the introductions of the characters changes s role. no longer does the storm rush in to illyria and alter it rather the storm becomes about  alone. the play is made into something seen from s point of view and she is turned into its main character something reinforced by gormans decision to give actress darcy gerhart a solo bow at the end of the curtain calls. this is to my mind a mistake. as with the rest of s best comedies twelfth night is almost the exemplar of an ensemble piece. certainly the play can no more function without  than can the proverbial  without the prince but while a weak  will inevitably doom any production of his play a weak  can be compensated for. hers is not even the longest role she has scarcely fifty words more than does . viewing twelfth night as s showpiece leaves it as off kilter as does the single set. this is not to say that gerhart does not deserve her applause. convincingly boyish as  in a 1950s tintin sort of way with a wispy fake moustache whose existence is only revealed at least from my seat when  removes it at the end she is particularly excellent at subtle shifts towards greater masculinity in her performance whenever  realises she has just put her disguise at risk. she manages posing as a callow youth rather better than she does the weightier moments of the role but makes up for this with her comic abilities   her desperate attempts to keep s arms away from her chest when being embraced by the latter lady are particularly fine. as  arlin dixon is rather disappointingly one note leaving the character something of a flighty fool. gorman bucks the trend to view the major key of twelfth night as being nostalgia but sometimes errs too far on playing for laughs. dixons over the top passion for  is funny but its all there is to her while it is possible to give the character some depth. the issue of mourning for her brother is almost occluded despite her gradual shift in costume from black to red. dixons sheer delight at the thought of there being two s is delicious but s contention that  cannot be mad because of her ability to order her house seems weak simply because  does not come across as capable in that regard. to be fair considering what does go on in her household over the course of the play her abilities are generally questionable but this is taken rather far here. actually running her household and often running off with the show is scott farley as  who provides a funny and complex performance. both actor and director resist the urge to overplay the role and though i at times had the distinct sense of having read the same reviews of major productions of the play as gorman given some of the choices made with one exception his culling is excellently integrated into the show. s authoritarianism and self regard are perfectly blended and the round of applause farley received on his exit from the garden scene was exceedingly well deserved. avoiding the facile choice to present s desire for  as sexual rather than the textually accurate desire to climb socially farley presents a humorously tortured majordomo whose quasi hysteria when he believes himself on the verge of seizing his aimed at end combined with his attempts to calm himself down achieves a rare pitch of hilarity. this  succeeds in one of the more difficult acting tasks   overacting just enough but not too much. he is perfectly suited to the world of this production. in fact the only true issue i have with this  is that of his moustache   or more precisely its disappearance. farleys face is festooned with a marvelous handlebar moustache that perfectly suits his conception of the character. it is clearly a fake and while he is locked up it is lost. without it farley looks much younger and in fact almost unrecognisable and what reasoning there is behind this loss   and its reappearance at s hands at the very end   is invisible to the audience. perhaps it is meant as a symbol that s gravitas is fake that his authority is plastered on but this does not come across. farley is also to be commended for his brave attempt to deal with asking sir  and company whether they make an alehouse of my ladys house when my ladys house is an alehouse. said sir  is played by david tripp and his growly raspy bluster is a highlight of the evening. again the production proves the value of not overdoing things and tripp avoids being too farcical a lush while remaining distinctly disreputable. the constant presence of his cane later revealed as concealing a sword also adds to his performance making his threats of violence quite credible. his relationship with alison blairs  is set up from the start and progresses throughout the play so that the announcement of their wedding at the end is no great surprise. blair brings a wonderful and nuanced authority to her role and is extremely credible as the brains behind s gulling. it is perfectly clear that sir  and sir  are entirely under her thumb. sir  aguecheek is another highlight of the production thanks to christopher manousous. manousouss performance manages to make the role seem much bigger than it actually is. as dapper as he is foolish he shows enough signs of maybe just maybe having a dim appreciation of his own dimness and slowly wins over the audience till a great aww of sympathy greets his final exit as he gains a certain dignity in his refusal to show himself crestfallen at being revealed to himself by the man he thought his friend. but mostly he displays a wonderful ability to make a fool of himself and an almost hysterical cowardice that makes his encounter with  one of the great set pieces of the evening never better than with their mutual agreement to get down from on top of the bar. sir  not realising that he has to unsheathe his sword is bested only by the moment when he kicks  between the legs only for  to take rather a few seconds to realise that she ought to be writhing about in pain. one advantage i will grant the choice of setting is that it allows  leete stetson to be given the role of bartender which means that he is present from the start rather than being a sudden addition to the cast halfway through the play. stetson makes an able assistant to sir  wholeheartedly helping in the prank on  until he starts to think things have gone a little far at the end. rounding out this quintet of characters of questionable courteousness is alexander offord as  who despite often being inaudible gives a fine performance displaying his abilities on a variety of stringed instruments including guitar ukulele mandolin and banjo. his impersonation of sir topaz the curate is especially fine the alternation between his own voice and the quavering old mans being another brilliant set piece. he also sings his songs well though his final song was cut down to a single verse reinforcing the feeling that the performers were racing against a clock. true the setting of when that i was and a little tiny boy is quite dreadful so having it finish early is something of a blessing but giving only one verse leaves it so short there seems little reason for  to go to the bother of starting to sing. this is a particularly so given the decision to open the play with a song thats not in the play. it would be better either to cut it entirely or to give it in its entirety. these five work wonderfully together and rather overshadow the romance plot. in part this is due to one of the other issues with this production very few of the actors can speak the verse with dixon being a particularly egregious culprit in this regard. as the scenes involving sir  and his companions are in prose they do not suffer from this while the characters involved in the  plot are hampered by what sounds like their attempts to speak their lines as if they were prose. this spoils some rather lovely moments of the text as well as leading to a final scene that left me quite cold due to the sheer rush everybody seems to be in to get things over with. this scene does however have a detail i greatly appreciated namely the little nod from luis lopezs drunken priest confirming that he has not only married  and  that afternoon but also sir  and .  and  played by will king and christopher legacy respectively do their best with unrewarding parts. theres not much to be done with  whose role is essentially to be pretty and willing to marry the first strange rich woman who insists that he do so. the two suffer from gormans decision to meld their first two scenes into one another choice necessitated by the use of a single location. this is one of those moments that reminds us that  knew what he was doing the sheer strength of s passion is lost when we do not see him decide to follow  in spite of all dangers just as s quest does not come across as being as powerful as it is unless we see him leaving comfort and friendship to pursue it. beyond that judging from the growing restlessness around me mashing the two scenes together makes for one rather long and quite boring scene. in fact all in all the production does not seem to know what to do with  and despite legacys best efforts he is little more than a plot device one whose purpose is not fully clear. something similar is at work with the presentation of  liam volke. again the use of a single set works against the actor the whole point of s passion is that he never pays court to  in person. in fact there is no evidence that  has ever even met . having him hanging around in her bar leaves one wondering why he has such need of messengers. but beyond this there is nothing in the production to   out from the other characters.  is the duke of illyria but despite the presence of  at his side daryan boys making the most of his time on stage there is no sign of power or authority to the duke here. looking like nothing more than a hipster ish graduate student  is bereaved of power and entirely alters the dynamic of his relationship to . as a client of her bar it gives her more power than he has which is not the situation at all. in the text s refusal to bow to her liege lords desire is a testament to the strength of her lack of interest in romance and of her will. here she is simply refusing a customer. the title of the play gives us a clue into its underlying theme twelfth night is a time of momentary overthrow of authority. when there is no authority present it loses its meaning. though this is clearest in the overthrow of  the challenge to authority is not restricted to that plot but is also an added dimension to the triangle between duke countess and servant. lacking any sign of authority volke is left merely rather hysterical and somewhat dim a pompous ass whose views on women are as rebarbative as his taste in sweaters is poor. still despite my reservations there are many fine things in this production and the audience is kept well amused.,3,Comedy,Negative
Twelfth Night,Not Too Serious Twelfth Night,Melissa Crismon,in saloon style  a fool played by alyssa bradac encourages the audience to join in with hey ho the wind and the rain opening  orange countys jovial twelfth night with song and tomfoolery and yes rain well sprinkles. karissa vacker as a likeable  and marisa costa as the beautiful  have the larger parts and they play well off of each other as  falls in love with  dressed as  a page. costa  wheezes with excitement near hyperventilation as she speaks to . she cant contain herself as she twirls in dizziness thinking of  or rather . her infatuation and devotion should be enough for  to fall in love. same for s love for . jeffrey james lippold walks on stage as tall dark and handsome looking like he just came from a historical romance novel photo shoot with his white shirt unbuttoned but costa  wants nothing to do with him. costas  must be blind adding to the silliness of this production.  fredrick jones as sir  and kevin swanstrom as sir  are diverting as they make trouble. jones is a sweet drunk as he doesnt overdue his tipsiness and makes plans with the sexy amanda arbues as . swanstroms sir  is too simple to understand s flirtation. arbues puts his hand on her breast the buttery bar. his voice fluctuates from high to low like a cartoon character dancing around and making dim comments playing an amusing fool. his playfulness is much like mozart in the movie amadeus plus the obnoxious laugh. with s love letter from  to  planted on the ground walcutt  reads it out loud as jones sir  swanstrom sir  and michael drace fountain  relish their mean trick. they move the plants closer to listen in. fountain takes walcutts cane unnoticed. the men continue to move around moving away from swanstrom leaving him exposed. he takes a bouquet of flowers to hide behind that walcutt takes too blinded by love to notice someone holding them. everyone is a fool in this production and a fool for love.  is sure  loves him. with cane in hand as a microphone he is center stage as a vegas elvis punching the air then leaning into one knee. as silly as  can be walcutt plays air guitar and sings  as if no one is watching. bradacs  is the clown out to prove  a fool. bradac delights the audience with her singing trumpet playing and expressions with her raised eyebrows as she proves the other characters are the true fools. shaun  as  has a small part but in those few scenes he is pleasantly surprised when costa  plants a kiss on him. how quickly some of s male characters fall in love.  is able to make his character believable as he follows  easily to wed. the stage by eric barker is set simply but cleverly looking modern with geometric shapes. it doesnt give any hint as to what to expect as the stage appears modern and the costumes more victorian. the color is monochromatic white on white. different lengths of rectangle paper strips are adhered to vellum paper forming an uneven circle for actors to enter center stage. on the sides is more of the same creating another larger unfinished circle to enter stage right and left. a single color of light shines through the vellum creating more interest when the orange light glows the strips of paper look like a setting sun for the island theme. lighting design is by  and jennifer georges who also composed original calypso inspired music for the production. costumes by katie wilson are not any particular time frame they are more to fit the tale of the character. marisa costa is dressed like a countess in a black dress and veil to morn her brother. one of her more interesting dresses is colorful with multiple patterns and colors. the skirt is striped with an underlying pattern peeking out that is multicolored polka dots. to fit sir s outrageous personality swanstrom wears a pink wig with pink coat and knickers to hint of an iconic mozart. director thomas f. bradac and co director alyssa bradac produce a funny twelfth night that doesnt take itself too seriously. when the sprinkles threatened the play alyssa bradac as  keeps singing and puts her hand out taking notice of the drops of water the audience laughs at ease many other times too. take a hoodie and blanket for this amphitheatre.  orange countys festive twelfth night offers a night of laughter. the comedic production is easy to follow at a quick pace making  palatable for this eager audience.,4,Comedy,Positive
Twelfth Night,Some Achieve Greatness,Eric Minton,in terms of playwriting   may have reached his zenith with twelfth night. the main plot is suspenseful fun the subplot slides in and out smoothly and what a cast of characters its s play to be sure but top billed actresses have variously played her  or  while actors have done star turns as  sir  belch sir  aguecheek and . weve even seen show stealing portrayals of    and  afterthought character though he may be. indeed every character in this ensemble piece is a fully fleshed individualized creation except maybe the priest and even his eight lines earn appreciative applause when joshua morgan chants them in this folger theater production. still even  at his best is not good enough for director robert richmond. as he does with every  play weve seen him helm for the folger he has to fiddle with scenes tweak lines cut key moments and remold characters in addition to shaping the action to his conceptual setting. some of these decisions create fault lines in this production. however richmond also has a knack for assembling superb ensembles and allowing his actors to soar to scintillating states of singularity with their characters. most importantly he keeps twelfth night a comedy so he scores a night of many laughs and lively fun along with some enlightening an moments. richmond seeking an appropriate illyria in time and place for todays audience settled on the early 20th century and he pegs the action to the sinking of the lusitania off the coast of ireland in may 1915. in costume designed by h hale and in scenic design by tony cisek who has erected a giant tiffany like stained glass disc hanging over a third of the stage and a spiraling gold trimmed staircase to one side this twelfth night has a downtown abbey cum titanic look and feel. subconsciously we are in the time of nevermore the dreamlike days of daisy and her bicycle built for two before the first world war forever put mankind on a path of sequential nightmares. the timeframe also brings attention to the class distinctions  toys with in twelfth night. this is an ordered society with clear demarcations between the upstairs world of  and  and the twins  and  in their original state and the downstairs world of   and  the disguised . sub stratifications place  and aguecheek as something lower than  while  must curtsey to . be not amazed right noble is his blood  tells  referring to  as if to assure her shes not marrying below her station. of course she originally thought she was marrying well below her station when she wooed  and was more than willing to do so. meanwhile  and  fudge these lines and  sees himself readily overleaping them.  chris genebach in a portrayal of unceasing virility at first seems eager to be a servant for the  he rescued  service was an honorable occupation in those days and appears to be a step up for this  however in subsequent scenes genebach falls back to the now standard portrayal of  as a gay man crushing on . richmond opens his production with the twins apparently on a cruise ship dressing together in identical mens clothing a superfluous exposition that trevor nunn also used in his film version of twelfth night. after the ships sinking  and   vaughan and emily trask respectively dance in long strands of fabric a device we saw taffety punk use in its production of the play earlier this year. as with the punk production this ones opening line is s what country friend is this? spoken to  instead of the sea captain. richmond then starts shufling his scenes together. we get the captains er s expository description of illyrias gossip interweaving with s opening scene of  if music be the food of love play on and a manufactured scene of s household in which rachel pickup as the countess speaks the lines that in s original  delivers to . twelfth night is so often produced this is the 19th stage production ive seen that i doubt theres any new ideas a director could bring to the play. yet ive never seen a  belch like the one craig wallace delivers. wallace as he did with his gremio in taming of the shrew and his brother in much ado about nothing both also at the folger has a way of coming up with the freshest of readings when he plays a  character. i feel like i am hearing s lines for the first time so unique are his takes on them. a rascal of a man his  is the carefree carouser of his age the privileged adventurer unconcerned with victorian morals he even seems to be modeling himself after victorias son prince edward. yet he knows his place its above  and  and even among his peers aguecheek he sees himself as superior in guile if not in intellect. sir  in a squealing gadfly of a performance by james konicek wants to emulate  but he just doesnt have the mental capacity or immoral fortitude to do so. noticeably he sneezes whenever a woman is on stage. allergies probably. wallace presents a key pivotal point in  that ive never seen before but on reflection seems so right. when  breaks up his fight with  whom everyone believes is  she berates her uncle as ungracious wretch fit for the mountains and the barbarous caves. wallaces  genuinely upset by this approbation reaches out to touch his nieces shoulder whereupon she rounds on him again rudesby be gone a hurt  saunters off the stage and we immediately see a different side of his relationship with . shes a favorite niece perhaps whom hes come to aid in her time of loss father and brother in less than a year a woman he genuinely drinks healths to albeit a few too many. this reproach from  comes before the prison scene with  and it gives greater weight to s re i am now so far in offence with my niece that i cannot pursue with any safety this sport to the upshot. in this speech  is giving instruction to  and he ends it with come by and by to my chamber. wallace though clearly directs this last line to . tonya beckmans  is so elated she can hardly contain herself for she is and always has been it seems dotingly in love with . beckman plays  with bubbly bawdiness and a genuine love for life a kindred spirit to . and lord how she cannot stand . as astonished as i was by wallaces  richard sheridan willis as  topped any ive ever seen. not just pompous but religiously so this self centered steward maintains his ramrod dignity even when after being punked he comes smiling to  looking like a bumble bee in a 1900 style swimsuit with codpiece and garters crossing from the yellow and black stocking on one leg to the pants bottom on the other leg. a pearl necklace completes the effect. in the letter reading scene richmond cuts many of the asides by  aguecheek and  replacing  who has been totally excised in this production. this choice does not diminish the scenes comedy for all the laughs are focused on williss reading of the letter and when he pauses to figure out the m.o.a.i. anagram the other three hiding behind chair column and stairs come forward urging urging urging him to figure it out. an even bigger laugh is accomplished with his leaving the stage through the audience after reading the first half of the letter then returning and scattering the conspirators who have come out of hiding with a shout of here is yet a postscript that postscript commands him to smile and williss  urges urges urges a smile to break through the cement of his stern countenance. this is as good a gulling scene as you will see anywhere. s prison is the piano an ornately gold trimmed grand to one side of the stage where morgan when hes not playing minor characters like the priest and officer plays tunes to accompany the action hes using an electronic keyboard as the piano body must hold . willis not only lies cramped in the piano while talking with sir topaz he stays in that prison through the intervening scenes till his release in the final act. his being there doesnt distract though because the action is so enchanting from the foolish fencing match between aguecheek and   gains her confidence as she scores points on the knight to the more earnest duels between  and  and then  and finally to s snaring  whom she thinks is  and the finales sweet reconciliations. rachel pickups  is a scared tremulous young lady definitely shaken by the double doses of death shes endured. she emerges from that cocoon with the coming of . its not just that she changes from mourning clothes to a vibrant blouse and dress her whole demeanor becoming outgoing bold and warm. by the time  comes on the scene pickups  is a woman he could easily fall head over heels for in an instant. emily trask is much more contained in her portrayal of . she gets a bit rambunctious when shes doing the willow cabin speech she downright crows i am the man when she realizes  has fallen for her she grows impatient with  when he refuses to credit women with the capacity to love as much as he and she becomes cocky when shes besting aguecheek at fencing but all this is in contrast to her otherwise stiff reserve as . but trask gets the tear ducts flowing in that last act as  says i had a sister and trasks  nods just ever so slightly a gesture that perfectly captures a woman whose long lost hope has been magically rekindled but yet she doesnt dare accept that this is her brother in case it really isnt. the irrepressible louis butelli takes on  ukelele in hand singing s songs as well as classic tunes of the plays era. ever twirling his bowler hat and dressed in a natty music hall emcees suit butelli plays an allowed fool in name only. his delivery of the lines emphasizes their profound wisdom rather than cynical irony.  vaughan plays  as a boy on the verge of manhood as yet navigating newly experienced emotions while displaying an uncertain cockiness. describing his sister to  he says a lady sir though it was said she much resembled me was yet of many accounted beautiful and vaughan delivers the line with such abashed aplomb that it earns a laugh. michael brusasco is an overwrought  at the start delivering the plays first famous line as an affected lament. this lost in love and everybody should know it aspect dictates his performance to the final scene when it leads  to become a bit too scary as he threatens to murder  andor . however brusasco does such a deftly quick turn when he comes to the describing of  as one whom i tender dearly realizing the moment he says it how dearly he has come to tender this boy that the would be monster changes to a hollow fool and comedy again fills the vacuum. such surprising moments in this production arise out of what remains of s 400 plus year old script. among other cuts redmonds trimming away many transitional lines cause the final scene of sweet reconciliation to lurch along rather than unfold like giftwrap. meanwhile he devotes stage time extending transitions from scene to scene with piano accompanied keystone kops like stage business of characters crossing the stage side to side back to front sometimes dancing sometimes skipping and often pausing at center stage as if posing for a photo a motif that starts with  taking pictures of the twins before the shipwreck  i know i dont get it either. its forced foolery at the price of whittling away more of s rich fodder that this cast could have turned into a greater gold. well what you will my takeaway from this overall

Twelfth Night,Museum-Piece Shakespeare Still Manages to Have Heart,Eric Minton,in the spectrum of s comedies from funniest midsummer nights dream comedy of errors to darkest cymbeline merchant of venice and all the quivering needles hovering over each play along the way twelfth night is smack dab in the middle and its shades stretch almost from one end of funny to the other end of not so much. s most poetically mature rom com has slapstick sophisticated comic situations and clever word play but it also has a dark undertone that gives the plays  candy a hint of iago and it has a melancholia that lingers even after the happy ending. if a director or acting troupe in the case of the american  centers actors renaissance season a few years ago chooses twelfth night is a romp in the park while other directors have turned it into a play as bitter as troilus and cressida. the ascs tempt me further tours production is neithernor. in keeping with the text centric ethos of the asc this production layers no conceptual theme onto the play but it also has no particular mood nor does it create a multidimensional emotional landscape. as it played on the blackfriars playhouse stage during a preview run before the company heads out on its national tour this twelfth night is museum piece . richly costumed by erin m. west in detailed tudor clothing the action is more poetical than natural. characters come and go through the audience but once on stage they remain insular and sometimes surprisingly static. in the box tree scene the conspirators do nothing more than stand at the back of the stage holding branches in front of them as they idly watch and comment on s letter reading. the concocted fencing duel between  and aguecheek ends before it begins so we dont get to see how oxen and wainropes cannot hale them together as sir  belch had promised. the real duel with  instead of  turns into an intense grappling match between him and sir . in his program notes director  basil concentrates on the frequent references to madness in the play and argues that  was equating love with insanity. basil himself apparently takes this equation seriously and seems to play up both meanings of the word mad as well. fortunately the actors in this stellar company present most of the characters with great psychological fluidity and bring rich renderings to their portrayals including some refreshingly keen readings of roles through which countless actors previously have tread in lockstep. that this company emerges with so many new insights in a production that seems intent on wringing the play of its heart is reable. concentrating on the plays poetical attributes is not a bad thing either given the great poetry  produced for this play and that lexie helgerson cast as  is ideally suited to the task of speaking the best of it. she sat like patience on a monument smiling at grief she says to  patrick earl who understandably grows increasingly fond of her. make me a willow cabin at your gate and call upon my soul within the house hallow your name to the reverberate hills she says to  stephanie holladay earl who understandably grows increasingly enraptured by her. jacob daly as  is a look alike to helgersons  in costume only but they behave like brother and sister. shes a spunky lass who while mourning the believed loss of her brother quickly jumps back aboard the charabanc of life with determined humor. hes a spunky lad who easily tears up at the memory of his believed lost sister but is just as eager to get on with his next adventure too.  looks for appropriate opportunities to make a play for  as for  when the gorgeous wealthy  throws herself at him he wastes no time and little debate in jumping wholeheartedly into her company. brother and sister whatever weeds they wear by their very bearing and behavior invite the doting of both men and women. holladay earls  has a disposition for merriment from the start and this comes out in her ultimate desire to have  back at her house. perhaps her show of mourning is to put off  for this  is merrily intrigued by the manner in which the strange youth first approaches her house. upon meeting  holladay earls  moves quickly to fascination slips easily into infatuation turns suddenly to smitten falls directly into a crush and is soon giddy in love. once  has reached that state though  arrives just in time to requite her feelings. the notable aspect of this productions  is that his aesthetic is not his alone but imbues the whole court.  embraces the arts especially music and poetry in his pursuit of that state of being called romantic love he is more in love with the notion of being in love than he is in love with the person of . the rest of the court enables him both molly gilman as  in urging him to hunt the hart and especially patrick midgley as  who returns from his failed embassy to  all smiles. all smiles? well you see hes going to report on her vow to mourn her dead brother till seven years heat and in sharing this news through his own poetical skills  knows rightly that  will roll into a romantic passion which earls  clearly delights in doing. its a subtle piece of acting on the part of midgley and gilman in tandem with earls lighthearted  and it lays the groundwork for s subsequent realization that true love is residing right under his nose his attraction to  takes root in their first scene together. if only for his lovely voice  goldwasser is a hit as  but he also thoroughly explores s jokes and lines and plays them with deep resonance. this  though is a fool for hire he never strays from the notion that hes earning a living with his jokes and songs and so he plays the part of sir topaz in the gulling of  perhaps he bows out of the box tree scene because theres no money to be made merely watching  make a fool of himself.  has the assigned job of holding up a humorous mirror to everybody and so he does for  when the plot against the steward is uncovered in the final scene and thus the whirligig of time brings in his revenges he tells .  can feel sorry for  but she gets the joke.  of course will have none of it and he departs in revengeful anger. david millstone brings zero comic mannerisms to  in his first three scenes. this steward is ultra serious by choice his way of establishing superiority over the rest of the house and perhaps  too he merely shrugs away her criticism that he is sick of self love. in private though  lets his fantasies of marrying  have free reign and come on who of us hasnt fantasized bedding someone well above our state in wealth beauty or stardom? does that mean this  is in some way relatable to the audience? yes it does and so when millstone engages in one of the most delightfully ridiculous cross gartered yellow stocking presentations ive ever seen it reflects on our own similarly embarrassing moments too. interestingly his departure in dignified anger at the end of the play generated laughs at the show we attended i hope it was nervous laughter. though his elaborate tudor costume includes a big red bow strategically hanging just under his belt buckle rick blunt gives  belch a sinister edge. even when he is entertaining sir  aguecheek a gleeful seth mcneill a sense that  is ever aware of how hes fleecing the knight permeates the atmosphere. s sudden public turning on aguecheek in the final scene is vicious but weve seen this mood of his before in the box tree scene as he watches  blunts  seethes. in his fight with   intends to harm. certainly  was adept at interweaving drama and danger through his comedies and even his most comic characters could have a dark side. still if a production chooses to take this shading of the text too seriously it threatens to impinge on the comedy of the resulting scenes. i suspect however that this is a production thats still maturing. given the actors obvious talents across the range of the touring companys three plays along with the tight ensemble work in the other plays and their accompanying musical performances the individual elements of this twelfth night will likely gel in time. aguecheek perhaps holds the clue to this productions ultimate potential in his hands. when he threatens to leave illyria he walks on stage carrying in addition to a suitcase a teddy bear and an old baseball glove. as these are anachronistic props for this tudor set play they may as well be thematic items one is good sport the other is pure love. s illyria can ill afford to lose either.,3,Comedy,Negative
Twelfth Night,Twelfth Night’s Jazzy Background Doesn’t Hit All the Right Notes,Jennifer Kramer,the philadelphia  theaters production of twelfth night boasts an impressive and intriguing set of inspirations including the culture of the jazz age the paintings of magritte and the music of the academy award nominated the triplets of belleville. despite this pedigree however director carmen khans vision fails to capitalize on the potential of its antecedents resulting in a solid but sadly uninspiring production. the most successful execution of khans vision comes courtesy of set designer lisi stoessel. the simple yet elegant design recalls the less esoteric seaside landscapes of magritte as well as the marine motifs that occur throughout the text. varnished floorboards like the deck of a ship stretch back to a single rail occasionally framed by sheer white curtains a white muslin cyclorama backs the set amplifying the lighting changes for each scene. carefully chosen period props carried on and off by the players complement the action with a minimalist grace. the set reflects a whimsy and subtlety that is generally missing from the rest of the productions elements. vickie espositos costume design seems intended to produce a similar sense but by comon fails to deliver. for the most part the 1930s theme offers a low key background to the action of the play but it is marred by the small details in the intimate seating of the theater every wrinkle in the characters linen suits is visible as are s limp hair net and distinctly non period sneakers and the poor fit of s mourning dress. while sir s multitudinous pockets do allow him to secret away an impressive array of bottles to support his drinking problem his inexplicable explorer outfit makes him visually distinct at the price of some distraction. some costuming choices more successfully mesh with the productions intended tone including s rainbow hued shirts and socks that recall the whimsically deployed umbrellas and s yellow stockings sock garters and matching old timey bathing costume especially when paired with his butlers coat and bow tie in a hilariously counterintuitive attempt to regain his dignity. however the overall effect falls short of achieving a truly meaningful contribution to the intended interpretation. khan cites the triplets of belleville as a major influence  obispos score deftly captures the wit and vitality of early french jazz and the songs are admirably performed by lesley berkowitz and the rest of the cast but ultimately the musics use is disappointingly mundane lacking spontaneity and improvisational spirit. khan mainly features the music when and only when one expects it during scene breaks and as accompaniment for the songs called for in the text. this lack of innovation is compounded by technical difficulties including erratic volume control and on at least one occasion the unceremonious termination of a song mid phrase. these flaws contribute to a perception of the music as an afterthought instead of an essential feature of the production. though khan elicits consistently strong performances from the cast the broadness of the acting style detracts from the effectiveness of the play the deliberately over the top portrayals do not always appear to be a natural fit with the actors emotional and comedic instincts. this broadness at its worst instead seems to act like the theatrical version of a laugh track informing the audience of the plays pathos or hilarity instead of generating it organically. however several actors do manage to own this stylization and it is perhaps not coincidental that their characters are already written as somewhat larger than life. lesley berkowitzs  augments a fully natural seeming absurdity with an almost otherworldly air that sets her fool apart from the other characters mere foolishness. meanwhile jered mclenigan is at his best when he pushes s lovesick lamentation to its absolute limit throwing tantrums over s rejections while flopping all over victoria rose benitos petrified  like a limpet with no sense of personal space. rob kahn however steals the show as  putting his exquisite comic timing to good use by imbuing all the put downs and pratfalls with a hilariously overbearing and misapplied dignity and making  surprisingly sympathetic even as he suffers his richly deserved comeuppance. the purpose of this broad acting style eventually becomes clear as khan utilizes the light hearted tone to help resolve the uncertainty of the plays finale and enable almost the closest one can get to an uncomplicated happy ending for twelfth night. much of the gender ambiguity has been breezily glossed over so s attachment to  being initially based on an electric physical attraction and s love for  being impeded by her role as his manservant are both apparently resolved by producing an identical twin of the proper gender. this felicitous conclusion is not without a price however avoiding any complex examination of the plays questioning of gender roles means that s reappearance at the end in her womans weeds feels more like a surrender to cultural norms than a character reclaiming her identity for example. the most successful resolution is for  who has been amusingly but not gratuitously abused in the course of the play he storms off after promising revenge but reappears with a drinks cart during the shows closing song still sporting his butlers coat bathing costume and yellow cross gartered stockings. his willingness to resume his previous role implies that his sense of dignity is bruised but unbroken   as is apparently his lack of self awareness of his innate hilarity. khans denouement is straightforward but not superficial attempting to resolve several problematic aspects of the text by capitalizing on artistic choices carefully signaled throughout the production. the success of the conclusion unfortunately is built on creative decisions that fail to be fully realized for much of the play. the potential of the cast and artistic design seems greater than the final production   a respectable and at times very entertaining production but ultimately slight in comon to the greatness promised by its influences.,3,Comedy,Negative
Twelfth Night,Swivel is One to Watch,Archie Maddocks,swivels twelfth night at the cockpit theatre directed by diyan zora who is also the co founder of the company is a comfortable and confident second production read about swivels first production here. in her interpretation zora imagines an illyria modeled on 1920s tangier as a land in which anything is possible. twelfth night is staged in one of the most appropriate venues given the atmosphere it aims create. the cockpit theatre is located just off church street a famous et road rife with moroccan and other arab cuisine and garments lending authenticity to the piece. moroccan music provided by khalid salik and mohammed abdi greets the audience upon entering the theatre. ornately decorated cloths litter the stairs at the back of the stage underneath a projection of images depicting life in 1920s tangier. a delicate cloth is draped in an arc from wall to ceiling interrupted in the center by a ding arabian lamp. a dreary orange haze created by lighting designer amaya molis helps to emphasize our transportation into a far away land creating a sense of both warmth and weariness relaxing yet engaging. swivel as stated in their mission statement has made a conscious effort to mix the traditional with the modern by balancing creative license with traditional interpretation. the idea of setting twelfth night in 1920s tangier a place so mixed up that anything could happen is a masterstroke. this setting adds new aspects to the characters and re invents their struggles yet does not lose any of the integrity present in the original script. it really is a breath of fresh air. while the space at cockpit may be limited swivel produces a delightfully ambitious piece of theatre. if anything the simplicity of the set designed by pilar sierra allows the actors to show off their skills. the use of moroccan cloths clearly demonstrates where the piece is set without being ostentatious. the costumes designed by catherine arnold depict a totally mixed society in terms of both people and culture. the piece opens with  in a bright red traditional bedouin tunic. his status as a moroccan nobleman is clearly defined through his clothing yet it seems that nerves get the better of aqil zahids performance at this point. he appears uncomfortable on stage and does not exude the sort of arrogant sense of entitlement expected from a nobleman in his situation. he is particularly juxtaposed against his loud clothing. nerves appear to overcome the majority of the cast as the play opens. far too many lines of dialogue appear to be rushed by the actors. this results in many of the great lines being lost in a flurry of speech. had the actors slowed down when delivering some of their lines many of the words would have had time to resonate. this was one of very few blemishes on the direction from diyan zora which was otherwise impressive and engaging. after a rocky start the play suddenly explodes into a plethora of activity and comedic intrigue. the acting throughout is solid and the actors play their parts well and with the necessary authority required  becomes a much more authoritative figure as the play progresses and his status as nobleman becomes more defined. a particularly wonderful moment in the play is when   and sir  played by leo marcus wan tony wadham and matthew gibbs respectively stumble in drunk before quarrelling with  played by tibu fortes for their noisy entrance. the actors have such wonderful chemistry together that it makes the scene thrilling to sit through not too mention packed with laughs. in wan swivel have found an actor whose impish and energetic qualities shine through his singing in particular is particularly enthralling and his inquisitiveness is endearing. he manages to make the audience sympathise and laugh at his character simultaneously. all in all twelfth night is a terrific effort from the young swivel theatre company. after a shaky start the acting grows solid. the direction is sound the music fitting and the atmosphere welcoming. expect some intriguing and entertaining theatre in the future.,3,Comedy,Negative
Twelfth Night,Hapless Malvolio Makes For A Hilarious Hour of Theatre,Vikki Jane Vile,the egg is a cosy and intimate venue attached to the larger theatre royal in the heart of baths town centre but upon arrival i am hugely surprised to find such a young audience awaiting this matinee performance. scores of schoolchildren who barely look old enough to attend secondary school fill the foyer which leads to me believe i am in for a more light hearted afternoon that i had anticipated and thankfully i am right. this is the fourth in a series of tim crouchs solo works re imagining s plays from the point of view of peripheral characters which was commissioned specifically for young audiences. stipulations included that the production should tell the story of the host play and also that all necessary accompaniments should fit inside a suitcase. as the audience take their seats which are unallocated and shaped more like long settees than rows of seats another nice informal touch  is already on stage muttering allowed to himself and clutching s heavily creased letter. the set as is to be expected is sparse but as i will go on to see still heavily effective almost indicative of the imprisonment  is presently suffering. the costuming is intriguing and i can only think to describe it as an excrement stained over sized baby gown finished off with of course those now crumpled and faded yellow cd garters. on a rail to the audiences left hangs malvios servant attire which we see him gradually change into over the course of this hour long play. crouch manages to be harrowing and hysterical all at once in this fascinating one man show. ill be revenged on the whole pack of you he assures us deeming the audience bullies i lost count of how many times crouch breaks the fourth wall of theatre   audience members are continually singled out for criticism their hair their clothes their lateness just as he was bullied and humiliated by the protagonists of twelfth night which is where meat is added to the bones of understanding the young audience have of the play. the opening monologue is an unrelenting ramble about the impact of dropping a solitary piece of litter the piece of litter in question is s letter and the escalating consequences from such an action an action which  believes to be indicative of those bullies and slack jawed youths of today. in this show designed for all ages it is the puerile and the immature that works best and the younger members of the audience are beyond hysterics when one young boy is invited into the stage to kick  as the sign pinned to his back advises. all fun and games then? no. this is a production that flicks from the bawdy to the bleak in a matter of seconds. you think thats funny do you? the audience is asked repeatedly and undoubtedly it is however from this chaos the real context of twelfth night is pulled out and the farce of the protagonists is retold in child friendly fashion. again were asked you think this is funny? and im not sure whether i want to laugh or cry for the man in the oversized baby gown. it is far more comfortable to just laugh along though which is what everyone does. darker moments include  standing on a chair having pulled two audience members from their seats eager for them to help him hang himself. titters are still omitted from the young onlookers but this is a serious moment quickly dispersed by crouchs superb comic timing and we are all once again at ease. as the production concludes  has not forgotten about the revenge he earlier spoke of as the audience are told to stay sat exactly where they are and not to move until his return. he doesnt of course which leads to a couple minutes of audience bafflement before the first bravely makes the decision to leave. so what to make over all of this unusual show which is a mix of educating school kids in  revenge for past mistreatment comedy and an emotional outlet for a character who has had his heart broken? i hugely enjoyed crouchs work it is highly entertaining poignant and fits the criteria it was created for especially the capsule set. i only cannot help but feel a few more references would have been nice. the show could be longer and go further into s turmoil but at the same time in this show designed for children crouch has pitched it pretty perfectly.,4,Comedy,Positive
Twelfth Night,Transformative Twelfth Night from Delaware Shakespeare,Jennifer Kramer,while in modern times  generally holds the privilege of having produced the most famous version of the stories he adapted one of his lost plays offers a contrasting case. in 1613  and  fletcher wrote the history of cardenio an adaptation of one episode from an international literary sensation a founding work of western literature and a major influence of the novel as an artform miguel de cervantes el ingenioso hidalgo don quijote de la mancha better known as don quixote. fans and academics have naturally mourned that any of s material has been lost but one also wonders what was lost from centuries of scholarship and appreciation that s transformative work in conversation with a titan of spanish literature left behind only a few potentially derivative texts and a song. for many it is easy to forget that  was not some static pillar of art but an artist influenced by global events pop culture and evolving forms of storytelling. fortunately delaware  does not have that problem. for their 2022 community tour they are launching an ambitious adaptation of twelfth night as a bilingual musical mash up tackling immigration and refugee rights that very much refuses to let  stay in isolation. co written by director tanaquil márquez and composer liz filios twelfth night o lo que quieras wears its transformative nature proudly. the dialogue and lyrics weave between an english spanish and modern american english delivered by talented actors whose performances ensure that the audience understands what is happening regardless of their facility with the current tongue. soliloquies are delivered in song in a characters native spanish or both press conferences and news reports helpfully deliver exposition in a satire of the 24 hour news cycle heroine violeta izzy sazak quotes other  plays for emphasis. though s twelfth night is best known for its cross dressing chaos its plot is driven by a refugee hiding her true nature so she can get a job and the cast and crew eagerly expand upon this obvious parallel to the trials of many contemporary undocumented immigrants. several of the characters roles are given modern updates which both tie in to the new plot and highlight how the uneven power structures still shape society.  justin yoder is the governor of illyria ignoring the refugee crisis on its shores in his pursuit of  sydney banks she in turn has inherited a corporation that runs the countrys immigration detention centers with seemingly little concern for those impacted.  jered mclenigan is her cfo attempting to expand their business by whatever means necessary while activist street performer  ximena nte tries to enlist their local supporters to protest against it. delaware  follows the model of the ten thousand things theater and uses a theater in the round setup and natural lighting for their touring production. designer cesar viveros set is by necessity minimal the largest piece is a wheeled screen of painted bamboo a golden cage most notably used to detain  just like he detains immigrant families. the costume design by anna sorrentino is also on the minimal side a modern dress production that quietly augments the characters roles. violeta and  wear coordinating shirts patterned with tropical flowers a nod to the portrayal of their home in maracaibo in the musicals prologue however the colors are in muted shades of orange and brown reflecting a desire not to draw attention to themselves.  has the opposite desire their white button down may blend in with the rest of illyrias restrained fashion initially but the back is embroidered with butterflies macaw wings and the protest chant of si se puede. the rest of the illyrians demonstrate the outsize effect of politics and corporations on their society with outfits ranging largely between business formal and business casual from  with his matching gold ascot and pocket square to  whose emotional rebirth is played in strict girlboss fashion by switching from an all black pantsuit to a pink blazer and matching flats. even  in his yellow cross gartered stockings with matching short shorts and corset insists on keeping his shirt and tie. izzy sazak delivers a powerful vocal performance as violeta while giving equal weight to the characters multiple emotional dilemmas not only the familial grief and workplace crush carried over from  but also a sexual identity crisis at s advances the discomfort of concealing her undocumented status and her growing awareness that aiding her fellow immigrants may require her to risk her assumed identity. sazaks confident performance transforms violetas arc into a bildungsroman where the resolution comes about not from her romantic fulfillment but from violeta choosing her place in the world.  ximena nte likewise gains an added dimension as the production takes the an fools ability to speak truth to power to its logical modern day conclusion where truth is spoken to power with a megaphone and a crowd of protestors the audience. ntes  is charismatic and dedicated to their cause without losing the characters playful humor a key part of the productions success. ntes excellent chemistry with newton buchanan  belch and paul harrold  supported by tai verley as  provides a near perfect version of the plot against  jered mclenigan that ties in to the productions new storyline while remaining hysterically funny. mclenigan gives a wonderfully unhinged performance unleashing rictus attempts at smiling and megalomaniacal laughter in superb counterpoint to the cartoonish choreography of the conspirators hiding behind palm fronds held in front of their faces. at the same time the actors use this hilarious chaos to contrast more somber ramifications like the effect of s egocentric power trips on the vulnerable or the disappointment that sir  and  will not follow through with their support for s cause. director tanaquil márquez not only keeps a steady pace through the production   a necessity for the elaborate adaptation   but also nicely balances the flow of musical numbers new material and s original text. the music itself is excellent and its rich warm sound is all the more impressive for being performed by the relatively small cast accompanied by music director  vitale. standout numbers include prologue which introduces the productions elaborate reconceptualization with beautiful interpretive choreography and sigo adelante which would be a show stopping ballad if the indefatigable show was in fact capable of being stopped. the new material in the story is direct and blunt sometimes veering close to too on the nose but saved from becoming an afterschool special by the casts earnestness and talent. for all its additions and elaborations the production keeps the majority of s twelfth night however it doesnt seem to always know what to do with it. with the plays setting in a modern more gender equal illyria violetas crossdressing lacks a clear impetus and does not offer much self exploration about her own identity though it does at least enable her attraction to . in a somewhat confusing adaptational choice  is now antonia tai verley and the characters subtextual attraction to  is now fully text   a choice which does not quite gel with another adaptation making antonias past crimes in illyria based on smuggling refugees over the border. antonia stating that she risks her freedom out of love for  does not hold quite the same weight when she literally makes a job out of risking her freedom for other refugees. the end of the musical seems on the surface to be a subversion of s twelfth night where marriage is the restorer of social order. only  and  wed now explicitly for the purpose of getting  a green card which is probably the most logical explanation for s choices available while violeta rejects  for his failures with the realization that she can never make him care enough. s sinister legislation is torn up but illyria is no closer to opening its borders and achieving a just resolution. at the same time while social order is not quite restored families are reunited friends are in alliance and leaders are seeking their proper place. the musicals conclusion answers the problems set up by  at the beginning of his play while its more bittersweet tone delivers an authentic acknowledgement of the complexity of the issues rather than a too neat turn into improbable fiction. though it may eschew the neat ending from s twelfth night the transformative work urges the audience to reach across the borders of different cultures and seek one out themselves   to literally transform the world. by staying in conversation with the bard delaware  delivers a powerful message in any language.,5,Comedy,Positive
Twelfth Night,Broad Humor in the Big Easy,Jennifer Kramer,though twelfth night is best known for cross dressing and misrule its action is driven by sudden sympathy fast friendships and unlikely alliances. it therefore seems appropriate that the hedgerow theatre has staged twelfth night with the collaboration of the delaware county community college drama department channeling youthful energy and soulful music into their joint production. the setting translates the plays allusion to the feast of fools to one of the most well known modern holidays of revelry mardi gras. scenic designer stephen wiseley offers a pitch perfect ode to new orleans with a brick facade smart blue paint and graceful wrought iron balcony accented by a jazz band of animal topiaries. mimi kenney smiths costume design brings a definite party vibe with bright colors and plenty of beads though kenney smith wisely assigns the array of flamboyant styles according to the characters flashy personalities.  sports a rich burgundy waistcoat and matching tie sir  dons a sunset hued hawaiian shirt with checked shorts and combat boots  and  both favor bohemian business casual in plum colored trousers black blazers and scarlet paisley silk scarves. meanwhile sir  in his sequined purple shirt matching hat and shiny rainbow striped trousers looks like he fell directly off a parade float.  starts off restrained in a simple though well cut black mourning gown but bares her shoulders and tucks increasingly bright flowers into her hair as she pursues . s outfit offers the fun modern equivalent of roving buskers in the form of the violently shiny silver suit of a living statue. the production adopts a broad tone which works well with the casts high energy and when necessary their inexperience. chelsea lombard plays a frenetic  which suitably conveys the urgency of her situation and the constant paranoia of betraying her façade unfortunately lombard maintains this loud panic throughout without offering any contrasting moments of s quick wit or quiet heartbreak. lombards effusive performance however does fit in with the productions thesis that love makes fools of us all. clark clements hilariously over the top  the rapid descent of  a charming sandra lawler into lovesick enthusiasm and even the unleashing of passion within daniel romanos    whether it be his sartorial dedication to his alleged mistress or impotent rage at his alleged possession   showcases the entertainment of such emotional extremes. while the style of humor remains broad the supporting cast makes the most of it by emphasizing its gradations. the contrast of a foolish and foppish sir  dontay driver with a blustering sir  ray saracini and a drily sardonic  susan wefel creates a dynamic and entertaining interplay complete with musical interludes from  a nicely tuned performance from joshua peacock. peacock music director joseph nocella and stephen campitellis jazzy accompaniment all give the production its own distinct aural character which gels perfectly with its setting. nocella and director stephen smith also indulge in some musical humor nodding to such classical leitmotifs as the jeopardy theme or tubular bells part one from the exorcist. smith has an excellent command of the production judicious edits are made to the text without sacrificing any of the plays highlights and the brisk pace both suits the humor and keeps some of the less experienced an actors from being overwhelmed. while the production does not go as deeply into the plays gender bending as it could   s disguise comes off entirely as a necessity without any aspects of self exploration   neither does it completely eschew the queer subtext. lambert may have  hastily remove her fake mustache before her and s first kiss but clements little foot pop cheerfully subverts traditional gender dynamics. though the production has a few rough edges its enthusiasm cannot be denied. the hedgerow theatre and delaware county community colleges twelfth night is a fun and creative nola inspired romp a worthy collaboration between a classic play a venerable company and the future of theater.,4,Comedy,Positive
Twelfth Night,Opposites Attract In Twelfth Night!,Benjamin Alper,under the stellar direction of jaclyn hofmann the play opens with a thrilling scene where the audience watches siblings  and  become separated during a storm at sea. the severing of their connection helps reinforce the love  has for her brother and the pain at her presumed loss of him   which makes their reunion at the end of the play all the more powerful. twelfth night is the perfect play to stage at the start of the year. not only does the plays title refer to the 12th night after christmas but the plays focus on the tense balance between revelry and order is timely as we all recover from the hangover of holiday and new years celebrations. the atlanta  companys current production of twelfth night being performed at the  tavern playhouse is a fun fast paced and hilarious experience that will surely shake you from your winter doldrums. at its heart twelfth night is a play that explores the conflict between two opposite and extreme forces our desire for fun food and frivolity counterbalanced against societys need for rule and order. these two forces are embodied by the two most interesting characters in the play  the fool and  the stern steward. given the importance of these two themes to the play a successful twelfth night production hinges on the performances of the actors playing these characters. happily the atlanta  company has two great comedic actors in matt nitchie  and jacob york . this is my first time seeing york in a role at the tavern but after this production i hope to see much more. his performance displayed the perfect combination of smug superiority and total self absorption that defines . his ability to change his accent and tone of voice to communicate to the audience his true nature was brilliant. nitchie is a tavern regular who steals every show hes in and this production wasnt any different. s fools are often the smartest people on the stage and nitchie gracefully plays among the other characters charming both them and the audience in each scene he appears. nitchie also brought his musical chops with him beautifully playing and singing the plays famous songs. the rest of the cast is also impressive. rachel frawley is excellent in the gender bending role of  and establishes a real rapport with  marlon burnley making their marriage at the end of the play seem less surprising than it otherwise might. david weber  belch avery sharpe  aguecheek and  king  round out the rest of the comedic roles. the most hilarious scene in this production was when  discovers the note he believes is from  while belch aguecheek and  look on and mock him behind his back. hofmann smartly placed  front and center on the main stage with the onlookers on the balcony above. this allows the audience to see all of the characters while also creating the opportunity for some funny moments as  moves around the stage and the onlookers must duck and hide to avoid from being seen. smart staging decisions the casts physicality and spot on comedic timing all enhanced the comedic power of the show. surprisingly there were a few moments in the second half of the play when the audience was not howling in laughter. the  taverns intimate setting is a great fit for this type of production. the audience is planted in the middle of the action and sometimes even becomes a part of it. the music is delightful and the lighting and sound effects were particularly thrilling during s scene in the darkness towards the end of the play. twelfth night teaches us there can be too much of a good thing. too much fun and revelry can lead to disaster while too strict a lifestyle can call into question the point of even living at all. however after seeing this production i was left only wanting more and thinking to myself can there really ever be too much of a good thing?,5,Comedy,Positive
Twelfth Night,Outdoor Shakespeare Returns to Atlanta,Benjamin Alper,outdoor  productions are not only some of the most enjoyable ways to experience  but they contribute so much to our communities by bringing  to many who otherwise would not see his plays performed. seeing  in a fun and relaxed setting and as part of a larger outdoor festival atmosphere brings communities together and gives them the opportunity to engage with and appreciate s works outside of a classroom or a stuffy theater setting. following the closing of georgia s  in the park productions in piedmont park in 2014 metro atlanta has sadly been without an outdoor  production for quite some time. finally the resurgens theatre company has taken up the mantle with the prologue season of its north georgia  festival featuring performances of twelfth night and the tempest at mary alice park on lake lanier the author was only able to attend a production of twelfth night. the settings of s plays are so important to their interpretation that they are essentially characters unto themselves. therefore it is necessary for an outdoor  production to try and capture the plays environs as best as possible while at the same time not becoming too distracting to the overall performance of the play. thankfully one could not ask for a better location for an outdoor performance of twelfth night than mary alice park on lake lanier. set on a small field jutting out above lake lanier with the cool breeze coming off of the lake and the waves crashing into the rocks below the audience feels as if they along with  have been shipwrecked on the coast of illyria and thrust into the plays adventures. the resurgens theatre is an original practice company that until now has specialized in putting on productions of the works of s contemporaries. this experience in elizabethan theater has clearly prepared them well to tackle s plays. as an op company all of the costumes and staging were created with an eye towards how the plays would have originally been performed. this also means that the play runs straight through from beginning to end with no intermission which is a difficult feat for the actors but also helps keeps the play moving along at a brisk pace. although outdoors and in a large open space the performance still felt quite intimate with the actors frequently talking to and interacting with the audience. the stage used for the performance was reable for such a relatively small outdoor production in it included a full stage with multiple entry points a higher level balcony and a trap door in the stage to allow actors to appear from beneath. this helped the audience imagine they were in an open air elizabethan theater and seeing the play in its original form. in addition to the setting and the staging the actors were all top notch. the  role is difficult to play in that it relies so heavily on the subtle nuances that the actor playing  must convey to the audience who knows her true identity while still maintaining credibility with the role of  which the character is portraying to the other characters in the play. sims lamason pulled off this role beautifully and was enjoyable in every scene. the comedic success of twelfth night undoubtedly rests on the performance of the actor playing  the vain and pompous killjoy that is the subject of torment and derision throughout the play. thom gillott plays this role perfectly and the interactions between him bryan davis sir  tom thomas sir  and cate osborns  steal the show ms. osborn deserves special praise for managing to not miss a beat after swallowing a bug on stage mid sentence such are the hazards of outdoor  matthew trautwein as  the fool was equally hilarious and provided a delightful constant that linked each group of characters throughout the play.  is too often perceived as highly intellectual and academic and this has the unfortunate effect of discouraging many people from experiencing . outdoor performances such as the resurgens theatres north georgia  festival are essential to exposing  to a wider audience while at the same time bringing communities together in celebration of the arts. given the stunning success of resurgens prologue season i can only hope that this the prologue to a story that will continue for many more years to come. ,5,Comedy,Positive
Twelfth Night,Twelfth Night: A Space Oddity,Jennifer Kramer,for their thirteenth summer  in clark park has gone loud and flashy with their production of twelfth night   a glam rock extravaganza that attempts to rock out while tackling the plays examination of gender. glam rock with its own emphasis on creativity and blurring gender roles is an uncommon but eminently appropriate setting for the very musical play. scenic designer christopher haig homages the 70s bold sci fi aesthetic by balancing the subtle an asymmetric platformed stage backed by silvery panels of fabric with the blatant  and s crashed bright purple spaceship stage left. natalia de la torre provides an inspired take on the costume design.  and  with their caps green waistcoats and silver grey trousers stand out as the most sartorially restrained in illyria.  may swoop around dracula like in a plain black cape but she has a gold headwrap and eventually reveals a sparkling minidress worthy of tina turner. sir  aguecheek matches his magenta bolero to his thigh high boots and complementary pink glittery short shorts.  dons not just yellow stockings but a full body yellow leotard trimmed with neon orange shaggy fur. however the most eye catching is definitely  with green face makeup a purple ruff and head to toe tinselly fringe. unfortunately the cast matches the aesthetic with a similarly loud acting style sacrificing much of the plays emotional depth and reducing too many of the characters to one note caricatures. some actors are more successful in this mode than others. jess conda transforms  from jester to festival emcee and front man of her own band midsummer madness reframing her wordplay as banter with a concert audience and guaranteeing that all her puns get their own rimshot from the drums. shamus mccarty portrays a funny  as s evil vizier snidely lisping and sneering to great effect whether running the household sniffing her chair or twirling around in his yellow body stocking. josé raúl mangual sir  truly has a back trick as strong as any in performance history and mixes gymnastics with a good natured air headedness to good effect. the production also provides some interesting character interpretations. bailey roper plays  as young lively and immature flinging themself down the hillside lamenting the lost  or onto s back in a fit of playful glee  nichalas l parker in turn has the brotherly affection and exasperation of a devoted babysitter. confronting the performative nature of gender head on pax ressler charts s increasing confusion and the consequences for their own identity at the end of the play they eschew man or maid for something else choosing the name vi and becoming as  angela antoinette bey puts it your masters master mistress. despite the occasionally dragging pace which interacts unfortunately with the broad acting director jack tamburri generally does a good job balancing the productions moving parts. the music is a constant presence without being overwhelming   composers jess conda and elizabeth atkinson provide numbers based loosely on s original lyrics or on the events of the play excellent pastiches of glam rock and catchy in their own right. tamburri also enjoys playing with the fourth wall characters asides are set off with a spotlight and a chime riff from the band sir  and company not only hide among the audience but s throne is located right in the middle of them and he spends most of the play watching along  and the band meanwhile treat the whole production as their rock concert in the park with some incidental participation in the actions in illyria. it is also refreshing to watch a production of twelfth night that actually addresses the plays gender exploration. in addition to augmenting these with vis journey of personal discovery tamburri riffs on the casting practices of s time an all male troupe playing male and female roles with plenty of cross gender casting. unlike  tamburri is completely unconcerned about the necessity of restoring order by making sure everyone ends up in their assigned gender and part of a straight couple. while not always successful the enthusiasm and creativity behind reinterpreting a 400 year old play in a 40 year old musical genre to comment on the identities and lives of modern audiences gives the production an engaging vitality.  in clark parks production of twelfth night is a spectacle in its own right and well worth experiencing.,3,Comedy,Negative
Twelfth Night,PSF Season Opens: Suit the Words to Music and Action,Jennifer Kramer,the pennsylvania  festival opens their 2018 season with twelfth night one of s archetypal comedies. drawing on the plays musical background their production aims for a mix between the traditional and the creative while balancing an ambiguous setting with distinctly unambiguous wit and character work. the setting   illyria by the sea   is deliberately obscure. scenic and lighting designer steve teneycks set consists solely of a backdrop of narrow two story windows with a spiral staircase leading up to the balcony level. the rest of the set comprises a thrust stage with minimal props aside from a wall piano. the result hints at the tastefully understated wealth of  and  but at no clear architectural period. the costumes by a gajic are more directly indeterminate. s rolled hair and sharply cut skirt suit suggest somewhere around the 1930s or 40s  meanwhile wears black lace ball gowns and diminutive top hats that could imply anything from victorian mourner to fancy modern goth.  and  sport naval jackets and vaguely military striped trousers while the other male characters wear variations on the standard suit allowing for personal idiosyncrasies like s tramp hat with attached ratty wig. if anything is clearly established it is that s yellow stockings cross garter belt and lack of pants are too powerful for mere mortals and that sir s gilded floral shorts and matching suitcoats have never been fashionable in any period of history. however though the clothes avoid a specific time they do demonstrate the evolution of characters personal development. sir  and  in particular change literally for love. the former starts the production in rumpled underwear and a leopard print bathrobe and ends it in a mostly unmussed plaid suit and waistcoat.  meanwhile first removes her lace overshirt to transform her black strapless gown into an evening ensemble complete with pearls and opera gloves she then puts off black altogether in favor of a chartreuse yellow gown. presumably one must assume that her hatred of the color yellow is here attributed to a general loathing of bright colors during mourning. in a play where talented supporting roles frequently steal the show this cast is well balanced and uniformly strong resulting in a production that revolves around  victoria janicki while establishing her larger equally engaging context. janicki is both witty and earnest letting  pass it off as boyish charm without denying her more emotional moments. janickis portrayal of s reaction to music in listening or even in performing a yearning adaptation of sonnet 57 is a particularly nice touch not only do her feelings for  break through but their similarly passionate reactions  them as well suited for each other. akeem davis as  is both charming and amusing tempering his entertaining juvenile moping with genuine attachment to those around him. besides casting his frustrated passion for  as slightly more sympathetic than stalkery his easy physical affection explains and repeatedly elicits s own frustrated passion as well as hints at its resolution. as  meanwhile eleanor handley transforms from the living manifestation of a british stiff upper lip to a confident woman hilariously unused to the awkwardness of love and finally to someone comfortable with her passion and willing to roll with the vagaries of life like marrying the wrong twin or having to rescue her butler. greg wood gives  a similar level of over the top british propriety but without any release valve   resulting in hysterically funny scenes where even a mere smile requires a full minute of red faced strain literally vibrating with intensity. in contrast eric hissom portrays s easygoing clowning as a deliberate act over his self aware and slightly more world weary self. hissom is equally adept as a solo artist or as the frontman for the talented ensemble providing a throughline for the productions music. director matt pfeiffer is known for producing musical shows and twelfth night focuses heavily and justly on settings for the numerous songs included in the plays text. and some that are not lest anyone doubt that this is a true pfeiffer production  and  sneak in the obligatory rock cover with extremes more than words on the ukulele. the music is composed by long time collaborator alex bechtel who also plays sir  aguecheek with hilariously gangly enthusiasm   catchy while with its pianomandolinaccordionguitar instrumentation still fitting in with the shows ambiguously old timey aesthetic. pfeiffer handles the rest of the production with equal confidence. the text is lightly edited and the casts slapstick and extratextual comedy are nicely incorporated. apart from the final scene which winds down just slightly too much the production is steadily paced rolling forward to each new joke and musical break. the result is an excellent production that balances words music and action. with a firm foundation in s craft and their own considerable creativity the psf has achieved greatness with their musical twelfth night.

Twelfth Night,Blackfriars Scores a Jazzy Twelfth Night,Diana Louise Carter,on the centennial of women receiving the vote in new york it seems fitting to finally see woman take center stage even in the formerly all male land of . blackfriars theatres production of twelfth night directed by alexa scott flaherty upends the historical casting of  by casting a woman in every role. adopting as a setting the era in which womens roles in society took a giant leap forward   the 1920s   this rochester ny production leaves the audience wondering with amusement about love and gender. not to mention humming a tune. the show is a success. costume designer janice elizabeth ferger adds a layer of opulence with 1920s costumes shimmering with sparkles and fringe. the set is ostensibly a speak easy complete with a jazz trio. duke  takes on the appearance of a club owner and count  is a headliner mourning the recent loss of her father and brother. servants  and  become entertainers dancing the ton and singing backup for  portrayed by micayla greco as a sensuous and mischievous torch singer. the play centers on a young woman  sara michelle penner cast ashore in illyria and separated from her twin brother whom she presumes to be dead. she decides to make a go of this strange world dressed as a young man. then she falls in love with  who employs her to woo  the countess who wants no part of him.  erin kate howard falls for  however disguised as the youth . meanwhile s self important head servant  offends her lady in waiting who with her followers exacts revenge both hysterically funny and viciously cruel. mistakes in love and identity abound. unlike in s time the idea of actors playing a different gender than they are is not a social convention today. its still a novelty even while all female  productions are growing in popularity   see phyllida lloyds 2016 taming of the shrew or the national theatres 2017 production of twelfth night with tamsin grieg playing  as malvolia. the latter is an example of what i find a little confusing about what blackfriars does   change some characters to females and plays others straight as it were without explaining or making obvious those choices. all that is added on top of the plays existing gender identity swaps. blackfriars offers the unusual side by side comon of a woman playing a woman who is supposed to not so convincingly pretend to be a man and a woman playing a man believably. its always a toss up whether the star of twelfth night will be  or  linda starkweather in this version. starkweather is reably convincing. with short shorn hair an artfully applied mustache and skillful use of the lower register of her voice she makes you forget a womans heart beats beneath that mans three piece suit. while she retains the characters pomposity she also makes him a sympathetic figure as he receives much more punishment than his overblown ego deserves. penner is an enthusiastic . her expressive face is delightful to watch as  a conflicted jill rittinger finds himself irresistibly drawn to cuddling and swaying with her while his singers set the mood. this is one of those improvised moments scott flaherty has added that underscore the bards mistaken identity and gender themes. later when  is incarcerated and  visits him scott flaherty has  burn  with a cigarette to demonstrate just how far the jest at s expense has gone. drawing the actors from only one side of the gender pool may seem to present physical limitations but by picking a variety of body sizes from petite to big boned scott flaherty has peopled this twelfth night with plausible variations on female and male characters who arent simply androgynous. her  for instance a former sea captain who has been in some scrapes with the law before is played by stephanie roosa whose height and girth suit the somewhat menacing role perfectly. beth winslows height similarly serves her well in her role as sir  belch s incorrigible uncle. but age blindness in casting has some actors playing against type distractively so. winslows résumé suggests she may be older than she appears but her sir  still looks way too young to be s uncle and perhaps too young as a love match for a mature  judy mccaffery. a few wrinkles on sir s face might have helped. on the other hand a fresh faced kate armstrong made us forget that sir  aguecheek is usually played by an older actor. she brings physical moves only a young actor can pull off as she bumbles and stumbles drunkenly through wooing  drunkenly and trying to duel . she even plays some jazz age licks on a saxophone. brava clown brava. generally though the play hangs together nicely with a well developed concept. audience members have a choice to sit in the usual seats or at café tables onstage in order to add to the speakeasy atmosphere. original and period music handled deftly by composer and music director andy pratt add to the mood. and the cast operates as a true ensemble. the production is a fitting opener for a season blackfriars is promoting with the phrase theres something bold.,4,Comedy,Positive
Twelfth Night,Darkness and Brightness in Great Lakes Theater’s Twelfth Night,Yuko Kurahashi,great lakes theater opens its 2016 17 season with s comedy of mistaken identity and intrigue twelfth night with my fair lady in repertory. director drew barr illuminates the seductive mixture of comedy and sadness program note on the hanna theatres modified thrust stage. russell methenys scene design reflects both the somber and bright realities of the play. the rear façade of methenys box set consists of large windows with grids and central and side openings. the windows are partially opaque suggesting the winters frost. the backstage suggests a courtyard and a room where  recuperates after the shipwreck. the cyclorama which is lit in blue evokes the sea of illyria. the visibility of backstage is masked with semi opaque drapery. the upper corner of the box set provides a loft for the musician jillian kates. an aged chandelier above the center stage evokes an eerie atmosphere that resembles the world of miss havisham from dickenss great expectations. like miss havisham whose time stopped when she was jilted on her wedding day time seems to have stopped for  who has fallen into depression after her beloved brothers death. the subtlety of rick martins lighting design further emphasizes the contrast between the warms and cools in the atmosphere. his use of spotlights serves to cut out the actors like a picture frame adding dramatic intensity in soliloquies and dialogues. the director opens the play by telling without words the background story of countess  who recently lost her brother.  christine weber enters her late brothers room goes to his empty bed and picks up remaining keepsakes to put in a trunk while sir  belch aled davies carrying a sandwich in one hand and a flask in the other stumbles through the servants who are cleaning the room. this additional scene created by barr contrasts with the first scene in the text where  laments her brothers death in a shipwreck. this symbiosis allows the audience to prepare for the two womens entanglement in the intrigue of mistaken identity. one of the pleasures of watching a production of twelfth night is to see how the performance deals with the intersection between the main plot and subplot and barrs production did it with seamless scene changes. during the course of the show the major performance area quickly changes between s palace s house and the streets in illyria. in those multiple locations both the characters of the main and subplots meet and clash. davies sir  belch is an old drunken outrageous uncle with a good heart tom fords sir  aguecheeck serves as  belchs right hand laura welsh berg plays a prankster  guiding these two drunkards. in this production the trio emphasizes their lecherousness executing the bards lines with obscene gestures. laura perrottas  is in total control of the  trio by capitalizing on their simple minded drunkenness. m. a. taylor as  portrays a witty philosophical melancholic and sensitive fool who gives advice to both the main and subplot characters. the trios victim is s steward  played by lynn robert berg. barr chose to exaggerate s famous scene of yellow stockings with cross garters. berg as  parades in not only yellow stockings and cross legged garters but also a black corset. although entertaining bergs characterization of  and other characters reactions seem a bit outshadowed by his outfit. cassandra bissell portrays a sensible and considerate  disguised as . bissell carefully reveals to the audience her gradual infatuation with  who is in love with  then in turn falls for . juan rivera lebron as  emphasizes the characters self indulgence. jonathan christopher macmillan as s brother  exhibits his physical strength in the combat with the trio choreographed by ken merckx. kim sorensen has designed stunning costumes for the production. her black victorian dress with a long train and floral patterned underskirt that  first wears is exquisite. this black dress contrasts with the white floral patterned edwardian dress that she wears at the end of the show. however her black dress seems to overpower the actor and her performance. other characters costumes are more subdued serving to animate their unique features. s elegant sheer scarlet night gown and pants in act 1 reflect his melancholic personality.  and s dark blue double breasted coats with floral and vine patterns reflect their noble lineage even in disguise.  in a long gray pinstriped frock coat with a top hat reminded me of a circus ringmaster. the yellow and green costumes worn by the trio colorfully emphasize their silly schemes and merriments. the upbeat music for the electric guitar composed by daniel kluger adds a sense of timelessness to the show. kates the musician squats when she is not playing suggesting that she is a vagabond musician or another  who quietly observes all of the actions from above. sound designer lee kinney supplements the electric guitar with prepared playback sound. the 2016 production s the seventh production of twelfth night at great lakes theater. most recently the company staged it in 2009 directed by  fee artistic director of the company. in this production barr creates a contrast between the darker elements of the story and the façade of merriments and frivolity. as a result s song sung as the other characters leave the stage reminisces about the emptiness of his life.,5,Comedy,Positive
Twelfth Night,Youthful and Musical Twelfth Night at the PST,Jennifer Kramer,the spirit of childhood is not exactly the first association one makes with twelfth night revolving as it does around more adult matters like courtship grief and dirty jokes. yet director carmen khan has chosen to invoke this spirit for the philadelphia  theatres production of the play marrying it with a jazz age setting for an intriguingly breezy interpretation. bethanie wampols set is fairly minimalist. the wooden thrust stage stairs and framed arch are carried over from the theaters production of  currently running in rep the only added structure is the delicate railing running along the back of the platform. however smaller details of the set dressing work well to convey a sense of place billowing white curtains  s mansion and the colors of the cyclorama change with the mood and the characters fortunes. costume designer vickie esposito has somewhat more mixed success.  and  are clearly supposed to be dressed identically in white suits with distinctive cerulean argyle sweaters but her trousers are of an obviously modern skinny cut and he never wears the accompanying tan pageboy cap. meanwhile s clothing needs tailoring and her ghillies in her final scene appear to have been chosen solely because their thin soles keep actress elise hudson of a height with the other actors not because they match the setting or s personal style. however for the most part the costumes reflect the cheerful tone of the production. the color palette is bright without being overwhelming an echo of the rainbow umbrellas featured throughout and there are several cleverly evocative details. sir s kepi and gaiters suggest an adventurous military origin and contrast with the clashing patterns of sir s golf ensemble.  meanwhile is dressed in red and gold regency era breeches waistcoat and cravat with a black coat the period analogue to a modern magician wearing old fashioned evening wear. several characters wardrobes evolve as the play progresses   s blue silk pajamas give way to a white suit and teal shirt not unlike s and  and  start in dark structured dresses and end in relaxed flowing pastels   a visual symbol of their emotional transformations. one of the most successful invocations of the spirit of childhood is deaon griffin pressleys portrayal of  whose tumultuous onslaught of emotions seem to have been transported straight from his teenage years. griffin pressley plays each and every feeling as both incredibly intense and incredibly genuine music the food of love reduces him to a writhing ball of sensibility on the floor rising only to burst into a tortured singalong.  the result is hilarious and endearing   particularly to julia jensen rays  who clearly shares a sympathy with s strength of feeling. jensen ray plays  with an interesting degree of vulnerability and emotionality. her decision to pose as  seems less like an attempt to explore her identity and make her own way than an impulsive decision whose complications are as baffling to  as to everyone else her only anchor is her unrequited dedication to . it is a somewhat unusual take on the character and not unsuccessful act ii scene 4 in particular is deeply amusing thanks to jensen rays depiction of the clash between s sympathetic appreciation of s musical torment and her desperate discomfort at being forced to observe it while laying right next to him. however making  so uncertain erodes one of the driving forces of the play   especially since her battle of wits with  a scene inspired only by her own appreciation and defense of her cleverness has been cut from the production. as a result the anti  plotline gains greater prominence helped along by the casts energetic performances. rob kahn reprises his role as  for the philadelphia  theatre to great success the perfect mix of overbearing butlery dignity a complete lack of positive social skills and sock garters with matching yellow bathing costume. elise hudson gives  a genuine if fully platonic affection for her prickly servant unreservedly taking his part when the prank upon him is revealed and bestowing a sweet kiss on his forehead when he grudgingly puts off his promise of revenge in order to serve drinks at the engagement partymusical number that concludes the play.  ledent is a brash sir  at first only interested in drinking from the endless array of bottles secreted about his person ledent keeps his careless but funny attitude constant but alludes to sir s increasingly engaging with both the ingenuity needed to execute the prank and his admiration for the brassy  jenna kuerzi by slowly lowering the number of drinks he takes per scene. though his and others treatment of the somewhat sympathetic  and the definitely sympathetic sir   zak borders on cruelty the productions allusions to childhood give their pranks and unkindnesses an air of juvenile squabbling as opposed to systematic mistreatment. director carmen khan uses this repeated kidification to great effect it downgrades the stakes of the dramatic conflict without lessening its emotional impact in the moment allowing both pathos and confidence in the happy ending this production provides. the various lovers are content in their choice of partner despite last minute shake ups of gender and identity  appears to have taken no lasting harm from his mistreatment sir  is content to stare besottedly at  even as she dances with her new husband. however the appeal to childhood does come at the price of deliberately simplifying some aspects of the play. s cut scene and uncertainty decrease her characters agency. the plays questioning of gender and attraction is largely sidestepped  and  are unambiguously just friends  changes back into her womens weeds a white and unsubtly bridal dress for maximum heteronormativity and s blurring of her performed gender in the plays concluding lines is cut. yet overall the light hearted tone of the production feels earned. the philadelphia  theatres production of twelfth night is youthful without being childish capitalizing on the plays humor and plot twists with energy wit and music and reminding the audience of the lessons learned in the simpler days of childhood when the rain raineth every day sometimes the answer is to put up your rainbow umbrella.,4,Comedy,Positive
Twelfth Night,Magicking Twelfth Night at the University of Texas in Austin,Michael Meigs,traffic was at a near standstill at the university of texas campus in austin last saturday half an hour before the opening of twelfth night. i had to take a circuitous route commit myself to a long line ol cars waiting to enter the parking garage near longhorns stadium and fork over a 10 event parking fee. but not because of the production at the 244 seat oscar brockett theatre at the ut department of theatre and dance. id run into the mess of folks arriving for the touring production of the sound of music at the 3000 seat bass concert hall. i made it to the  production on time along with ut students groups of high schoolers and some ut faculty. the art and magic employed in this 400 year old piece by  greatly exceeded im sure the familiar set pieces of the touring version of the 1959 rodgers  hammerstein musical and 1965 film. but comons are odorous as dogberry tells us elsewhere in s world. the clever vigor of these undergraduate actors assured me id made the right choice. the thrust stage for this twelfth night is a rough square with simple platforms tall rear panels for video projections and what appears to be a smashed legless petite grand piano stranded at the forefront of the playing area. lights go down and a roiling storm briefly thrashes through the video panels. for long moments in the dimness a tall portly figure hums lolls about the stage banishes the violence of the storm with a wave of his hand and picks up a conch to hear the encapsulated sound of the sea. this is  the clown played by trey curtis. in this simple setup director robynn rodriguez firmly establishes ilyria as a place of magic. for this opening moment  has the mysterious magic powers of ariel in the tempest and that prepares us for transformations. we even accept the absurdity of duke s court being furnished with a destroyed piano that will be played by the extravagantly hirsute and mutely comic josh cole as the musician. the story of twins  and  separated by a shipwreck provides plenty of opportunity for misapprehension the theme of the play. dramaturg samuel blake supposes that twelfth nights separated siblings are an echo of s own twin children judith and hamnet deceased five years earlier at the age of 11 but thats a tenuous explanation. siblings and gender disguises feature elsewhere in s comedies including in the 1599 as you like it and its not until act iv of twelfth night that confusions between the timorous  and her robust brother  become the stuff of comedy in this piece. this is a plot device that goes back to plautus and earlier but its sure fire for comedy because the audience knows more than the characters. and s been here before not least with the double set of twins in the comedy of errors in the early 1590s. the magical setting established from the opening scene assists us in accepting the contrivance that folks in ilyria and elsewhere mistake one twin for another. kristen rainey and jake mcdermott do have something of a resemblance but hes a head taller than she. they wear identical garb in different sizes and comb their hair alike but only dullards or the enchanted are likely to mistake one for the other. but we as spectators are in on the secret and the laughter in the house showed that even  newbies were enjoying the comic confusion. in male habilements and counterfeiting herself as  the eunuch the shipwrecked  joins the court of count  the brooding gravel voiced keith machekanyanga.  loses her heart to the count who tolerates her as just another pretty faced boy and sends her off to deliver his entreaties of love to the gracious  rama tchuente shut away in deep mourning for the death of her brother. but love is both blind and insistent. olvia is captivated by this fresh faced insistent young messenger. director and cast have great fun with the clowns and gulls in this piece. riotous sir  belch austin greenawalt continually urges on the impossible ambitions of foolish sir  aguecheek ian price with the help of serving wench  adriana scamardi. haughty  steward of s household tries to contain them but quickly becomes their dupe a foolish figure and then distressingly a blindfolded and much abused captive. scene designer teena sauvola pulls off some technical magic of her own when it comes to inventing the cell for the unfortunate  for the soundboard and frame of that legless piano fold out and up into a sturdy cage. director robynn rodriguez is clever in her choice of physical types to fit these characters. long limbed red headed greenawalt carries off the figure of wastrel sir  with aplomb and prices rotundity mugging and astonished voice offer a fine counterpart. surely many in the audience were impressed to see that adolfo lambert as  has features much like those of james robert collier who plays the shrewdly duplicitious under butler thomas barrow in downton abbey. lamberts  is more annoyed than malevolent at the top of his household game and the happy imaginings spurred in him by his adversaries forging of a letter supposedly from his mistress are sweetly vulnerable rather than absurd. the entire cast has mastered lines and scansion. some are more accomplished than others. probably the best bard talker on stage is jadon hadley in the relatively minor role of s devoted friend  who dares follow him into enemy territory. wth precise articulation and pace hadley sets a through line for his character. examples of such calibrated craft were more common before 2013 the date when ut suspended its mfa program in acting. machekanyanga as  and tchuente as  are notably eloquent and attractive adriana scamardi as  the tricksy housemaid to  is particularly vivid in a role sometimes interpreted as a simple drab. curtis tenor voice gives s songs a pleasing air and the recorded music used for the smashed piano is appropriately reflective both for the opening scenes sweet strain and dying fall and for later brief interludes. lighting by yi tai chung serves both mood and character illumination. costuming appears to place this ilyria somewhere in times of the romantic but unaccomplished voyage of byron to the isles of greece in 1824. costume designer andie day assisted by a staff of nearly three dozen employees and students provides eye catching accoutrement including a full length captains coat in dark tan leather for  a prize for any mariner. the theatre further meets its pedagogic aims by running a twitterback discussion with the dramaturg after some of the performances. to a longtime devotee of  the 140 character exchanges ranged from the thoughtful to the inane the first sailor guy is kinda hot but when fishing for young plaice the more hooks the better.,4,Comedy,Positive
All's Well That Ends Well,Time’s Up for Rossillion,Jennifer Kramer,the pennsylvania  festival traditionally concludes their line up with extreme    an original practices production of one of s less performed works based on what is known of elizabethanjacobean theater where actors get a week of rehearsals to work out the direction costumes props and all the rest themselves. this years offering is alls well that ends well and interestingly this four hundred year old play delivered in a four hundred year old manner brings up some very current issues. the set has been borrowed from scenic and lighting designer steve teneycks work for the psfs earlier production of twelfth night a backdrop of narrow two story windows and a spiral staircase leading up to the balcony level. the actors match the minimal set with minimal set dressing using only two piano benches and a few trunks. the costumes are largely straightforward modern dress   with the obvious exception of  in a red vest with military style or possibly marching band style gold braiding ruffled and bejeweled sleeve garters sunglasses and a many plumed pirate hat. the noblemen at court wear suits with heraldic sashes and the soldiers reflect the international makeup of the duke of florentines army with an array of practical trousers sturdy boots waistcoats and the occasional uniform jacket. meanwhile bertrams uniform   tight pants engineer boots a black henley and a leather jacket   speaks more to his transformation into a bad boy than a soldier. s pink blouse navy pencil skirt and loafers fit her portrayal as a sober and responsible young lady interestingly her pilgrimage outfit shows a bit more daring and personality with jeans heeled ankle boots white wrap blouse and red ascot. s outfit appears to be a deliberate parallel with her white blouse chambray skirt and red bandana   both a thematic mirroring as potential loves of bertram and a foreshadowing of the bed trick where they are literally interchangeable. the cast is quite strong all around. there is a restrained but constant undercurrent of humor   mostly centering around jim helsingers blowhard  supplementing his textual ridiculousness with running gags about offstage slapstick and the general populations groans of disdain at the mention of his name. however eric hissoms clown  also provides some musical levity and the deliberately terrible prop newspapers with literal copying and pasting of headlines like  cures the king next to the respective actors headshots are an amusing touch. however as the female characters drive the majority of the action in the play their actresses set the rest of the tone with serious and impassioned performances. as  emiley kiser first appears sincere and mild mannered and though this seems to be her preferred demeanor kiser makes it clear she is equally comfortable bantering with  or masterminding a social conspiracy against bertram. susan riley stevens as the countess of rossillion links the countess personality with that of her sons showing a capability for intense affection familial for her son and  romantic for  lawtons  and flashes of temper when her will is thwarted. however unlike bertram spencer plachy a nice balance of spoiled yet redeemable stevens shows the countess with a firm grip on her temper never losing control. stephanie hodge  gives her character a similar restraint laughing off the annoying importunations of bertram and  however when given the chance to confront bertram in the court hodge unleashes s righteous indignation shouting down even the king and refusing to let anyone stop her from having her say. it is moments like these that highlight the parallels with todays culture when the timesup and metoo movements are bringing powerful men to justice and thrusting into the limelight the pernicious intersection of power structures and sexual harassment. bertram refuses to take s rejection for an answer and has been harassing her for months so a group of women organize against him and hold him accountable for his actions   even standing up to threats from other influential men in this case the king who tries to dismiss  as a sex worker and send her to prison. the company follows  in presenting the many shades of grey tangling this situation giving due emphasis to bertrams friends trying to warn him of  bad influence and to the injustice of the king using his political position to threaten not only  but bertram as well to make him marry against his consent. they do not attempt to impose an uncomplicated happy ending on this famous problem play but neither is their conclusion unhopeful  seems willing to attempt to be less of a problem the king yields to s and everyones protestations that he shouldnt enforce his matchmaking tendencies and bertram is on his knees before  and his mother with his head in their laps the posture of someone who is not only repentant but just as upset by his actions as they are. it is unfortunate that in addition to s words and theatrical traditions the social problems he wrote about have a resonance in our time as well. but the pennsylvania  festivals very good production of alls well that ends well shows that these issues can be handled with nuance and sensitivity in a compelling and timely drama.,4,Comedy,Positive
All's Well That Ends Well,PAC’s Problem Play is No Problem At All,Jennifer Kramer,despite being the only  play with a direct title drop any production of alls well that ends well that agrees with s statement has to work as hard as she does to convince the audience that she is correct in her assumption. the philadelphia artists collective addresses the twisted plots and character arcs that landed alls well its classification as a problem play head on throwing their support behind  with skill and sensitivity. director dan hodge accomplishes this by putting the focus firmly on the text and the actors. the theater in the round setup has no dressing and minimal props and the close proximity of the audience encourages subtle acting and magnifies strong emotions. the victorian setting is a good match for the plays preoccupation with class distinctions and sexual mores lending an effective historical distance while still allowing the action to be relatable. this setting is established almost entirely through costume designer  fritzs striking reproductions of nineteenth century dress. the rich fabrics with a subdued color palette draw attention to the characters but do not distract from them.  is still the flashiest dresser but this is accomplished through his cravat top hat and the maroon of his waistcoat trousers and matching trim on a cream colored coat. the color scheme seems to deliberately echo bertrams while his black mourning band and his mothers black mourning gown and veil provide a visual reminder of the melancholy events directly preceding the plays beginning though one does wonder why  is not in mourning for her father as well. the limited costume changes make those few changes more notable and dramatic. the exposure of  moral turpitude coincides with a more literal exposure as he is reduced to wandering barefoot with only his shirt and trousers the sick king swathed in blankets and ratty shawls in his wheelchair signals his return to health by emerging in a tuxedo and leaning on a dignified cane. s neat but simple blouse and blue striped skirt show her relative low status at the beginning of the play her immaculate white pilgrims outfit and giant black rosary defy the shades of grey that might have accompanied her plan to take s place in bertrams seduction her final dress a beautiful combination of lace grey silk and impressive leg omutton sleeves blends quality and taste with the dramatic sensibilities of an 80s soap opera star   a fitting combination for someone returning from the dead to announce a surprise pregnancy. the strength of melanie stefan watts performance as  does not come from indulging the plays melodramatic twists however but from balancing them out with genuine emotion. her tears are as much of anger at her hopeless love as sadness over losing bertram to the kings court   and yet stefan watts works in glimpse of good humor and lightheartedness in s banter with  and  hinting at her personality when not oppressed by circumstance. underneath all stefan watts gives  a steely determination that cures the king sends her on a pilgrimage across europe and engineers an elaborate plot to claim bertram as her rightful husband stefan watts shows it sustaining  past the point of exhaustion as the play comes to a close when  appears desperate not for bertrams love but for simply a resolution of the plays tangled events. stefan watts emotional performance strikes a blow against sexist stereotypes by portraying  as entirely driven by her feelings and yet never irrational or out of control. the rest of the cast picks up and capitalizes on this strength of feeling. laural merlington gives the countess a notable temper freely expressing her anger and grief at the increasingly terrible circumstances without losing sympathy by taking it out on others. the interactions between stefan watts and merlington and also with other cast members like  lopes as the king suggests a natural understanding between these similarly high strung characters that strengthens their sympathy with one another. this also underscores their rejection of  damon bonetti who is funny enough to be sympathetic to the audience without undercutting  pernicious influence his disingenuous emotional performance and skewed values confuse and repel them. bertrams actions and reactions elicit similar disapproval from the characters but thanks to akeem davis dynamic performance not from the audience. davis expertly assembles a character arc for this rather notorious part that shows bertram initially motivated by a self centeredness that is thoughtless rather than malicious finally regretting the consequences of his actions   though not quite fast enough to avoid hurting more people. nevertheless davis charm and sincerity give a hopeful cast to bertrams final passionate kiss with  even as he makes it clear that bertrams redemption has barely begun. by focusing on the emotional consequences of the plays flawed characters and moral ambiguities hodges direction refuses to shy away from the unsavory elements that earn alls well its designation as a problem play. he supplements the seriousness with a stately pace and mari mas somber accompaniment on the cello but still allows for moments of comic relief like  capture by the disguised ominous gibberish spouting  a gleeful joel guerrero. hodge also makes use of textual editing to enrich the plays character interactions  brian mccann brings the news of s apparent death and reveals his genuine regard for her under his clownish exterior. the result is a thoughtful and engaging production that is rewarding to watch   all is well indeed. by balancing the negative consequences within the play with the positive aspects of the characters the cast and crew of the philadelphia artists collective suggest that if everyone gets their act together things can end well also.,5,Comedy,Positive
All's Well That Ends Well,All's Swell and Ends Well,Eric Minton,the little boy wore a formal black suit coat and pants with white t shirt and red sneakers. his gap toothed grin ed him to be a little man reveling in his self assurance or he had just played a prank like locking a bathroom stall from the inside. i walked past him returning his smile i discovered the locked stall afterward and a few feet beyond him noticed a little girl slightly older watching the boy with a mix of envy and fascination. this was opening night for synetic theaters a midsummer nights dream in arlington va. but it took me back to the evening before when i saw the american  centers alls well that ends well at the blackfriars playhouse in staunton va. could these kids be the childhood versions of bertram and  in that play? clearly  has been crushing on bertram for so long maybe infatuated with his coolness that shes blind to his coolness toward her. in the asc version bertram is ever conscious of being cool and at best patronizing toward her. of course what comes before the play starts is as relevant as speculation. what comes after the play ends is of no consequence either it ends when alls well. fittingly director ralph alan cohen doesnt worry about past or future either but concentrates solely on what  gives us between act i scene 1 line one and the kings epilogue. and what  gives us is sharply written comic dialogue cleverly constructed comic set pieces and vividly drawn comic characters. alls well that ends well has always been one of my favorite plays but this is the first production ive seen that proves why that is so. in fact asc proves the play to be even funnier than i always thought it was. so many people myself included write that twelfth night is the last of s great comedies. they dismiss the nontragedies that come after from measure to measure to the tempest as problem plays which begs the question whose problem? alls well has no problems. it is a comedy by any bench. lost love found check. life reborn from pre play death check. pompous braggart gulled with a trick check. a jester serving as stand up comedian check. an old man with incisive wit check. funny characters funny plot funny lines check check and check. even the plays keystone moment when the just cured king offers  any bachelor in his court to choose for marriage is comical. cohen stages it so that the men are facing the audience and its clear in their shocked expressions that nothing against  remaining bachelors is their preference. maybe the bed trick with which  traps bertram is a problem for modern audiences. really what she even sees in bertram to the point of stalking him is a problem for me but in  it is what it is and its up to the actors in this case tracie thomason as  and dylan paul as bertram to make it believable. which they do. thomason and paul along with every member of this acting troupe demonstrate that for alls well  wrote characters as wonderful as any in his whole canon. one of those is  whom benjamin curns escalates to his proper place alongside such famous braggart buffoons as bottom dogberry and pistol if not higher. with   doesnt make his ridiculousness so obvious his foolishness is contextual and his repartee is as smart as benedicks in much ado about nothing. curns an actor of great intelligence who sounds the depths of the characters he plays doesnt just resort to mannerisms and slapstick he sharpens each line on a whetstone of wit. his dialogue with thomasons  on the virtues of virginity is an oscar wilde style thrust and parry delivered mamet like. all of the attributes curns brings to his  reach a singular climax in his speech of redemption after his fake capture and the revelation of his duplicity to bertram and the other french lords which he delivers with his head and hands in the stocks and leaning over sideways as he tries to pick up his trusty scarf from the floor. you gotta love what he says and laugh at how he looks saying it. the brilliant physical humor continues as he tries to exit through the stage door while still in the stocks. of the three purely comic roles in this play  is the most obvious and accessible. however  the countesss clown is the most obtuse fool  wrote.  jon phelps though delivers his lines with such precision that the audience in the show i attended comprising mostly high school students attending the asc theatre camp laughed at every joke. so did i and as often as ive read five times and seen four times this play before i had never understood half of what  was talking about. some trimming is involved but mostly its the expertise of phelps in mastering s language and getting inside the character. the comedy of  could be easily overlooked if not for an actor like rené thornton jr. playing him. the elderly courtier seems at first blush to be little more than a device to get both bertram and  to the court but  uses s shrewdness to give the audience a true glimpse into . these scenes establish s dry wit and thornton extends this attribute through the entirety of his portrayal using the gravity of the character as a platform from which to let loose his zingers. on  believe this of me he tells bertram there can be no kernel in this light nut. on bertram whom  had hoped to marry to his daughter before all the lies unfold i will buy me a son in law in a fair and toll for this. ill none of him. on the climactic reappearance of  mine eyes smell onions. i shall weep anon. even his incredulous tone in asking bertram pray you sir whos his tailor? when  comes on stage gets a laugh. its worth a quick digression to answer that question. costume designer victoria depew dresses these characters as early 1920s british gentry formal vests and suit coats for the men when they are not wearing british army browns the women in pretty straight line dresses and brimmed hats.  wears a grey pinstripe suit with embroidered cape and that orange scarf and  in knee britches black checkered vest bow tie diamond patterned stockings and dog cap. the countess wears an edwardian era mourning dress and allison glenzer inhabits the role with scene stealing grace and dignity. its natural to laud the flamboyant fervor of curnss  the cynical antics of phelpss  the surprising drollery of thorntons  superb acting all but truly great acting also is accomplished in the stillness and reserve with which glenzer plays the countess. the still grieving widow is determined to pursue joy if not in her life then in the lives of those she loves her son bertram and the just like a daughter . glenzer portrays this simply by the way she sits and observes and in the slight but vocal modulations when she converses with . in her interactions with  she holds an expression of strained bemusement the fool irritates her yet he would make her laugh if she would allow it and underneath this melded emotion lies the fact that  is a living remembrance of her husband who she says made himself much sport out of him. all of the actors have the trust and skills to build their portrayals from s clearly guiding hand even the first lord and second lord given wholly honorable bearings in the performances of respectively chris ston and tim sailer and the first soldier josh innerst who turns in a memorable role as the interpreter for the gibberish speaking enemy soldiers who supposedly capture .  harrell gives a dignified but funny reading of the king. when hes sick he takes so painfully long to sit down in a cushioned chair that we get a pretty good idea of the fistula that ails him so. after  cures him harrells king is lithe as well as lively demonstrating that this young woman has not only cured him physically but uplifted him spiritually too.  is one of s great female roles delivering clever repartee and taut introspection in some wonderfully constructed verse. thomason masters the role well. we easily see why both the countess and king come to regard her as a daughter. the role may be confounding for critics because  seems as pure and undaunted as a disney princess and is that such a bad thing? dont you wish your daughter and best friend were of that temperament? and because we have no idea whatsoever what she sees in bertram my commentary has always been that bertram has to be way good looking and paul is. bertram is the plays glaring enigma a role with too many holes for an actor to adequately fill. what are his initial feelings toward ? why does he so virulently refuse to marry her even though she now comes with great wealth and title at the dangerous displeasure of the king? how does he find it in his better senses to be so publicly disdainful of her? how does he find it in his sense of honor to treat  so dishonorably? and what in the end moves him to willingly eagerly even embrace ? paul offers answers to some of these questions in the plays very first scene. his bertram is still a teen age boy graduating to take his place in the court his first venture away from home. he is painfully naive examples crop up throughout the play as he fails to understand jokes as well as courtly protocols. in the opening scene he tries to involve himself in the conversation between  and his mother by asking what the king languishes of. when  replies that it is a fistula bertram in his most intelligent tone replies i heard not of it before. thornton speaks the following line i would it were not notorious with an edge that points to bertrams ignorance and the young man reacts as such. bertram also notably grows clearly agitated when his mother and  make much over . no definitive backstory here but paul shows bertram to be the one who harbors envy for . thereafter paul lets the text tell bertrams tale. by the testimony of  and the  brothers it is  who leads the naive bertram astray and his own lack of experience in society accounts for some of the nasty things he says about women here comes my clog spoken as  enters earns a vocal rebuke from the audience. he tries to lie his way through the final scene hitting obstacles at every twist and turn and along the way one thing becomes perfectly clear not only the king but his own mother too have greater affection for the lost  than for him. so when  magically appears he probably understands that she is the most resourceful person he will ever meet but more importantly he sees her for what she is at that particular moment the one person who can get him off the hook. and so as  has promised alls well that ends well for her certainly and for all those who adore her. is bertram really among them? well she did beat him at his game she is lovely shes carrying his child and by his own reckoning the sex was good though he only now realizes it was her. whether his stated affection is sincere or lasting is immaterial. the play ends here. if you dont look before or beyond alls well that ends well is a wholly satisfying comedy as it is made greater still in the hands of actors with such skill.,5,Comedy,Positive

All's Well That Ends Well,"Love the Man, Forgive the Vice: All's Well That Ends Well",Roseanne Wells,this years offering for  in the park a new york institution from the public theater is a double ticket of cunning women tricking men into getting want they want or what the men deserve. alls well that ends well directed by the esteemed daniel sullivan is a measured and thoughtful production set in world war i france. his eye for story and character with a strong awareness of the audience and where to pull the strings are conveyed with expertise by his cast crew and design team. sullivan captures the sweet innocence of europe before the world wars a floaty effortless elegance of civility and ignorance of the deep wounds that are to come. he employs scott pask to create a beautiful and functional set that has space for the actors to fill up a long balcony decorated with intricate lattices doubles the vertical space and it allows the bottom floor to have optional curtains while keeping the back open to see a serene pond. leaving so much of the park visible gives the viewer a sense of controlled openness and possibilities. small chandeliers hang from the top and symmetrical staircases on either side make it easily accessible for the actors. sets of chairs define the stage floor and although theres a surprise or two in pasks set it is reasonably understated for a  in the park production. tom kitt scores the opening scene with delicate piano music a waltz that encourages dancing yet simultaneously feels very proper and elite. jane greenwood costumes men in tails and ladies in flowing green dresses dancers who savor the moment probably thinking that theres nothing better than this. standing out painfully self conscious and awkward is  clothed in a restricting conservative black dress without a partner on the verge of tears. uncomfortable but trying to fit in annie se gets caught in the group of dancers and anxiously tries to find an exit without making a scene. she manages to get to a chair on the sideline only to be passed over as bertram seeks a dance partner. she is the odd woman out and she knows it. but  isnt a helpless victim she is overcome by love but shes also sly and resolute desperate and determined and she has a touch of sass that goes a long way. shes a little clumsy but she has good intentions and one of the best scenes is when she convinces the king to let her treat him we all wait for his heartbeat as se concentrates on her examination even shushing the king.  cullum as her patient is cheeky and whip smart tinged with sad acceptance that his body is failing before his mind. once he receives s potent medicine he becomes vivacious and even more saucy rolling in a wheelchair on a nurses lap with an open bottle of champagne. but with his new lease on life comes the full exercise of his power cullums authority and unadulterated anger at bertram for refusing s choice of husband is lashing and so fearsome that andré holland slinks meekly back to his newly acquired ball and chain. charming and handsome bertram thinks its a joke at first. when he initially rejects her the audience hisses and boos him but holland turns it around on us in semi mock protestation making our indignation into a fun moment. as the realization sinks in we see his panic move through hollands whole body. when  presents the enticing chance to run away to war bertram leaps at the opportunity and despite a sexy kiss on his departure he flees. we sympathize with him as  sacrifices him to save his own skin but when bertram returns to rousillion and lies about his supposed tryst with  he slides back to where he was. holland does an admirable job of creating a leading man that we really want to like but whose good qualities just cant make up for the selfish ones. poor bertram he never had a chance with  around. outrageous hilarious and squirrelly reg rogerss cowardly soldier is an instant classic with touches of affected language and mannerisms but also with the ability to make him a character. outfitted in loud red pants a navy military jacket extraneous metals and sashes and a well manicured mustache rogers manages to strike the right balance between ridiculous and pitiful. and when the soldiers in his own camp reveal him for the cowardly lion he is  knows himself and in his public shame he is shameless. luckily bertram has a strong motherly influence and tonya pinkinss countess has the moral compass that can try to keep her son on the better side of debauchery or at least give him the sense to be embarrassed by his actions. she is clever and dignified loving and understanding and when bertram and  independently leave her she grieves for them equally perhaps for  more. there are other great actors who leave their  dakin matthews takes a great turn as a loyal and fierce  while david manis as  looks perfectly foolish in a foppish toupee and a silly grin. the production weaves the design and the acting perfectly tom kitt uses strings to signify high points in s emotional journey jane greenwood dresses  and  in the same nightgown for the bed trick scott pasks muddy makeshift tents and  kaczorowskis blue tinted lighting take us far out of the courts to the rural battle grounds plenty of smoke flares crashes and explosions add to the tension of war. even the scent of cigar smoke lends masculine edge to the production. superimposing the world war i setting on it makes for a fascinating and engaging first half but the second half glosses over the reality sticking closely to the boredom and the foolishness that fills the time. sullivan doesnt get an opportunity to dig in and show the truth of war more because the play doesnt allow for it without some manhandling of the text than his dismissal of it. its hard to show the impact the great war had on europe with a text from elizabethan jacobean england but sullivan uses the framework nicely. sullivan is the master of

All's Well That Ends Well,All's Well in Globe's Mainstage Opener,Christopher Adams,having kicked off its season with a full length reading of the king james bible over easter weekend the globe opens its mainstage productions with alls well that ends well. the globes season is entitled the word is god celebrating the 400th anniversary of the kjv and featuring plays such as  and marlowes doctor faustus. if alls well has a less obvious connection to biblical themes at least its fairytale like plot and strong characters make for compelling viewing. indeed the globes alls well artfully directed by  dove is a clear energetic production with well played humor and strong acting. as with many globe productions the set is simple. a blue pole with garland creates an archway. the large back panels covered in a blown up etching of a countryside landscape hinge to reveal the same scene but in a darker color. the nighttime backdrop is used during s set up and interrogation scene. costumes are sumptuous and plush black to begin with though they grow more colorful as the action progresses. s flamboyant outfit garners a laugh when lafeu michael bertenshaw says pray you sir whos his tailor? musicians  lyons also the composer paul bevan nicholas perry neil rowland and richard thomas provide delicate accompaniment. the score features the celeste think of the sound in the nutcrackers dance of the sugar plum fairy lending an ethereal quality to the staging.  is a pro active an heroine she has a clearly defined mission statement 1. get the ring 2. get pregnant 3. marry bertram not necessarily in that order and she is unafraid to take the steps necessary to achieve her goals. no wilty waiting around to be suffocated no passing out of flowers. it takes a certain kind of an actress to pull off determined but vulnerable and ellie piercy does a superb job. she effectively conveys s struggle between her status and her desires. sam cranes bertram is something of an enigma. certainly bertram has an underwritten journey just how is one supposed to go from spurning lover to seducer to repentant husband? but crane wears a blank expression and reveals few of bertrams motivations. it is a strange juxtaposition since crane was so ebullient in last years 1 henry iv as hotspur. yet if in the end we are not fully persuaded of bertrams love then at least crane leaves clues. he clutches s handkerchief in his hand throughout the play a gentle reminder of her presence and his holding onto the object subtly suggests his growing affection or lessening of disaffection. as comic characters  colin hurley and  james garnon keep the comedy reably available. garnon whom i recently saw play  in the factorys randomized staging elucidates his thoughts on virginity in pitch perfect terms. s clowns can often be inaccessible but hurley finds just the right gestures to imply meaning. though with lines such as it is like a barbers chair that fits all buttocks it is hard to go wrong. sophie duval plays the widow mother to naomi cranstons  as a barely repressed do gooder and hers is one of the bigger performances. like  the globes alls well that ends well has its own well defined mission. it succeeds both in its ability to entertain large crowds and convey believable emotional journeys. good cheer is the rule of this alls well and any hints of problem play are tidily swept under the rug. the cast is universally solid with strong performances from the female characters especially piercy cranston and janie dees countess. the fast pace ensures that any lagging moments are quickly left behind. alls well is a strong start to the globes summer season.,4,Comedy,Positive
All's Well That Ends Well,All's Well - Or Is It?,Claudine Nightingale, this season at the national sees the staging of one of s rarely performed early tragicomedies. alls well that ends well is an odd play that presents an array of awkward themes a refreshing tale of powerful femininity set against a subversion of the typical elizabethan norms of class and sex. this becomes the backdrop for a love story that is drenched in trickery and seemingly devoid of any love at all. with what must be a satirical title from  we are faced with a dark fragile tale something that director nne elliott fully exploits. this sense that things are not as they seem pervades every aspect of this production. rae smiths set design is dark and imposing upon entering the theatre yet it transforms seamlessly and subtly throughout. with  mumfords innovative lighting design the dark looming hills metamorphose into a sparkling palace or a twinkling venetian garden and these transformations are both clever and magical. similarly the use of an animated backdrop different for every scene is particularly effective without being too obvious as to overtake the central action. this thematic incongruity continues into some detrimental costume design. time periods are confusing as are references to mythology fairytales and reality. whatever anachronistic point this is trying to make it distracts from the action of the play. that said the references to well known fairytales are a nice touch and conducted almost solely through costume  sports a red cloak as she sets off on her journey and her glistening shoes are left under spotlight at the close of the first half. to accompany smiths impressive stage design is a wonderfully magical score from  cork. from the very start the stereo effect of the musicians seated high above the stage left and right and the beguiling harmonies create a unique and entrancing atmosphere. this is really quite fantastic and highly effective work from cork. the company contains a wealth of performances that are truly mesmerizing. marvelous delivery masterful timing and some wonderful casting result in some electric performances. conleth hill as  practically steals the show with his swaggering bolshie presence on stage. hill is simultaneously a lewd oaf and a lovable rogue a fine balance to achieve. clare higgins also delivers a commanding performance as the boisterous emotional countess of rossillion. her formidable stage presence aided by her extravagant trailing black gown keeps the audience on tenterhooks. one moment she is seething with fury the next she is soothing and kind. most exhilarating is  ford davies portrayal of the king of france. a  giant by all accounts davies gently dominates the stage upon every appearance with a perfectly convincing portrayal of one twenty years his senior. wise and fair this king rules his subjects with a kindness and equality both sexual and hierarchical that would have been idyllic in elizabethan society and would be even today. the most problematic aspect of this play the skeptical duet of lovers is even more difficult to overcome in this production. although bertram is well cast  is not. george rainsford offers us a dashingly attractive yet playful and arrogant bertram who knows his place in society and wont take anything less than what he deserves.  however is not the  i would wish for in this particular set up. michelle terry is certainly feisty and shows all the fearless determination of a young woman who is set on defying the conformities of society to get what she wants. but where is her innocence? her sweetness? of these she is void.  must either be so headstrong in her demands that she appears monomaniacal in her obsession with bertram or she should appear as an innocent heartbroken wistful young girl who happens to be intelligent enough to engineer the successful obtainment of her desire. although terry provides many fine moments throughout the evening this interpretation of  is an unfortunate downside to an otherwise wonderful production. this is definitely a production to see for the set and music alone. add to that the several enthralling performances and the 10 ticket promotion associated with this production thanks to sponsorship from travelex almost half the seats in every performance are 10 this still fills the bill as a must see of the season. ,4,Comedy,Positive
As You Like It,A Transient Respite: Great Lakes As You Like It ,Yuko Kurahashi,the great lakes theater glts production of as you like it directed by  fee presents a tableau vivant rendering of the forest of arden. scenic and lighting designer rick martin projected trees and a big mansion on the screen offering a painting look. his simple stage is sloped from upstage to downstage right projecting a sense of the enormity of the forest that extends beyond the visible area. yet this forest is somewhat civilized and tame as seen in paintings of manicured lawns vegetable and flower gardens groves and borders popularized in the 18th and 19th centuries. indeed with the projected downton abbey like mansion for duke fredericks residence the forest almost belongs to the estate located just on the outskirts of the main ground. as the program note explains martins choice reflects the glts inaugural production as you like it in 1962. in the forest scene the courtiers stand and sing facing the audience alongside duke senior david  smith he also plays duke frederick who comfortably sits in a chair and sips a cup of coffee. martins design evokes the romantic notion of the forest insinuating european nobles desire to control nature as if they claim them as part of their possession. in resonance with this scenic design choice is fees period choice as evident in the early twentieth century flavored costumes designed by kim krumm sorenson. as the program notes confirm sorensons renderings suggest edwardian era 1901 14 court dress. duke senior and his courtiers wear huntingexcursion attires while duke fredericks courtiers wear black trousers coats and top hats visually contrasting the two camps of the men. the former is content with nature though tamed nature and their pastoral life as suggested by their serene outing and picnic while the latter pursues dictatorial power. what fee achieved in this tableau vivant pastoral and musical composer and sound designer matthew webb rendition is a visualization of an ironic similarity between the court and the forest. the two spaces and supposedly two opposing thought processes about life are actually close and interchangeable. this interpretation may explain why duke senior is not disappointed by the news that he regained the title money estate and power again playing the role of a ruler. the interchangeability of the two fee illuminates in this production also explains why duke frederick magically transforms offstage from a greed ind merciless ruler to a hermit. i have always thought that as you like its ending is rather ominous and dark foretelling a grim future because two power couples have just emerged. these couples  and  foreshadow the end of the short lived peace and stability of the dukedom. written in 1599 four years before the death of elizabeth i  might have heard on the streets and in taverns succession plans plots and intrigues that eventually led to essexs rebellion in 1601. yet for  and his company 1599 was the year of celebration the opening of the globe. being aware of this duality fee emphasizes the happiness and restorative power of the forest where the characters temporarily escape from the dukedom. indeed the forest of arden is the locale of the final scene with upbeat music and dance. fee states that it is a gift to be able to go to the forest of arden especially after we all have gone through brutal times. an ensemble of the glts acting company emphasizes the characters features personality and function in this transient but magical and rejuvenating world. veteran company member jodi dominick plays  whose sole focus is to marry not necessarily to love  nick steen. steen shows his athleticism in the wrestling scene with jerrell s who plays . a female  played by colorful and animated maggie kettering finds her male companion aubrey michael burns. this gender switch underscores female power as burns aubrey tied to the rope around his waist is pulled by ketterings . in addition it also illuminates the story of three women   played by mandie jenson and  who venture out to the forest after the banishment of . jonathan dyrud portrays a petulant  in the beginning scene. his transformation into a likable dude is rather sudden but that is what the script calls for. lynn robert bergs  is not overtly broody or melancholic. berg portrays a simple mediocre philosopher who is content with his style of living feeling proud of being different from other courtiers of duke senior this production omits  the character who often descends from heaven in some productions avoiding the presence of a celestial being lord  played by dany bó appears with angelic wings. the production also skips  a country boy in love with  in this production aubrey. this choice works well for the glt production which presents the play as a transient respite between wars and turmoils. as the plays setting is the edwardian era the audience knows that world war i is just around the corner and soon the forest of arden will become the wasteland a bleak landscape that the great war will bring.,4,Comedy,Positive
As You Like It,A Very Like-able As You Like It ,Diana Louise Carter,its hard to believe shake on the lake in tiny perry ny. is just eight years old. the company co founded by perry natives josh rice producing artistic director and pilar mckay managing director has brought a handful of talented actors from across the country. theyve parlayed arts grants into a moveable feast of  that travels each july and august from the shores of silver lake to as many as eight counties. this is  in the best and most accessible of an traditions outdoor venues minimal and easy to transport sets actors playing multiple roles and frequent interaction with the audience. while there are body mics and a sound system providing amplification there are no lights so shows begin at 6 p.m.generally and the scripts are modified so the plays can end before dusk. the formula has been successful enough to enlarge the cast to 11 this year and create some spinoffssponsorships mean most of the performances are free this year allowing fans to see the performances in multiple settings without having to buy multiple tickets. this years production directed by associate artistic director chad bradford is a delightful as you like it costumed in caftans and tiered skirts of the summer of love designed by nikki grey. a half hour of live music precedes the play including a lively version of the rolling stones you cant always get what you want setting the tone and era of the play perfectly. in this production the court is more in the imagination while the rolling lawns of historic mansions or parks call to mind the wooded encampment of the arden forest to which  and  will travel in disguise. the only scenery is a lace curtained wood framed backdrop. before we get to arden though the scheming  sets up his brother  to be maimed or killed by  the wrestler who has already dispatched earlier opponents. fight scenes starting with a pre wrestling tussle between the brothers are beautifully choreographed with  matthew  turning bright red when the unhappy and penniless  ladarius jamerson puts him in a headlock. the actual wrestling scene looks like something out of the world wrestling federation with a scene stealing  rice making the audience shriek in laughter at his antics. a few improvised lines a crotch pummelling of  followed by  quipping he can only speak in falsetto lord add to the humor without derailing the text. once  and  have clapped eyes on each other and  madeleine dauer has fled to the forest with cousin  sharon combs we meet  a courtier of the banished duke senior s father. the melancholy fool malcom tucker when hes not playing music practices his meditation while sitting with criss cd legs and arms outstretched and balanced on his knees as one might find a 60s era guru. this is a wry jacques who seems just as amused by his fellow forest dwellers as he is contemplative. this production is particularly good at making each of the denizens of the forest distinct appearing to be peopled by a cast of thousands. buxom farm girl  played by keith harper particularly stands out as a curvy wench who goes back and forth between demur and come hither wriggles. her or should i say his wig fell off opening night as she chased and was chased by . grabbing the lost wig harper looked   in the eye plopped the wig back on and ad libbed love me for what i am with a wag of his head. the character of  is often played with great bravado almost like a female  pan who insists on fixing everyone. dauers performance is more nuanced allowing the unsure smitten young woman to peak out now again from her disguise as ganymede the boy.  the vain charmless woman who falls in love with ganymede was played with more confidence than usual by jordan tudor who also doubled as a vocalist before and during the play. i would have a hard time believing she wasnt the understudy for  or that she wont play that role someday. in a small and young company like this one i presume the costume budget isnt large but grey and her assistants worked wonders. particularly beautiful was the purple and glittery gold of the god of love one of several roles played by margaret gayford. ganymede was a bit of dandy with bell bottom trousers and a floral frock coat. though all of the actors were skilled enough to double and triple as different characters without the help of costuming their clothing changes gave early warning to a thankful audience. swapping roles between the nasty duke frederick and the mellow duke senior josh marcks went from a nazi motorcyclist look in black with silver metalic spikes to a simple white caftan with love beads. at one point matthew  made a lightening swift change from  with a hard brimmed cap to  with a skull cap and red clowns nose at a speed that seemed almost unbelievable. bradford knows how to keep a play engaging and moving at a quick pace. even though there is essentially no backstage in the shake on the lake format characters seemed to drop in from nowhere sneaking around the audience to appear in the performance space for each new scene. he solved the problem of having too few actors to play the four couples getting married at the end  could have been charged with bigamy by omitting all but the brothers and the cousins they married. however his choice to omit s epilogue a monologue arguably as well known and anticipated as jacques seven stages of man speech was sorely missed. as a result a very pleasant evening of theater ended with a big question . fans may debate whether the epilogue really adds meaning and value to the play but they shouldnt debate going to this production hie thee hence to perry or any of the other venues of shake on the lakes as you like it. ,4,Comedy,Positive
As You Like It,As You Like It is As You Love It,Benjamin Alper,like  after he first meets  i was left speechless after attending the atlanta  companys production of as you like it at the  tavern playhouse. wonderful acting beautiful music and excellent direction all combined to make this production one of the most enjoyable theater experiences in recent memory. given how important music is to this play it features more songs than any other  play it was fitting that the entire cast opened the production with a song. i was pleasantly surprised to learn that the atlanta  company can sing and play music as well as they can act. the opening song sets the tone for the whole performance and lets the audience know that this is going to a fun evening for all. there are several musical interludes throughout this play which help make it more accessible and enjoyable for the audience. there was not a bad performance from any one of the cast members in this production. sarah newby halicks feisty yet vulnerable  was phenomenal and her chemistry with chris heckes  was believable and touching. halicks performance evokes a classic disney princess who is at all times smart beautiful and charming none of which changes when she takes on the role of ganymede. a deft gender reversal can be difficult to pull off. the actor must transmit to the audience and the other characters that she is now a he but must do so while not appearing too silly or farcical. dramatic changes in costumes or tone of voice can be distracting and can undermine the actors performance. halicks and director jeff watkins made the right choice to have s transformation to ganymede be understated. this allows the audience to focus on halicks excellent performance as opposed to just her wardrobe. hecke and halick play off each other very well and it is often the physical comedy between these two that is the most enjoyable. while the actors playing the main characters shine throughout this production matt nitchie is the star of every scene he is in. playing the melancholy and contemplative jacques nitchie brings a nervous yet detached attitude and physicality to his performance that never ceases to be hilarious. his substitution of a four letter word at the end of the line when he tells  that he is so full of pretty answers had me practically rolling on the floor. nitchie continues his streak of putting on wonderful performances even when he is not the leading man. other highlights of this production include nicholas faircloth oneil delapenha and kati grace browns depictions as the poor shepherds in the forest. their reable recitation of an language in the accent of country rubes is both impressive and hilarious.  peeples flamboyant portrayal of  was also delightful and very engaging. audiences are sometimes forced to suffer fools because the actors playing them are too over the top but thankfully peeples portrayal was just the right touch of absurd. as you like it is a play where most of the action takes place in the forest and this can cause many productions to focus on creating elaborate stage settings or costumes to showcase this exotic location. while this might be visually pleasing it can easily distract the audience from the plays beautiful language. this production however features a very minimalist set design. indeed when the play moves to the forest a stagehand conspicuously walks in front of the audience and places a lone potted plant on the stage which the actors occasionally pick up and hold when speaking about the forest. this type of theatrical device communicates that the play should be enjoyed and not taken too seriously and it also forces the audience to rely on their imagination instead of a pretty set to appreciate this play. rather than big set changes the effective use of lighting helps frame the scene and location transitions and the musical performances help bookend the acts. this too allows the audience to focus on the true strength of this production the wonderful performances by all of the actors. s comedies are sometimes dismissed as being overly similar and lacking in depth especially when compared to his histories and tragedies. but the atlanta  companys production of as you like it shows that this is not necessarily a criticism. when done right as it is in this production a performance of as you like it will still leave the audience in tears. just in this case they are tears of laughter.,5,Comedy,Positive
As You Like It,A Fun and Faithful Rendition of As You Like It,Jennifer Kramer,delaware  kicks off their second annual community tour with a lively production of as you like it performed at the red clay branch of groves adult high school. the community tour is designed to bring professional theater to underserved audiences in nontraditional venues and the combination of the diverse cast classic play and boundless energy invites all viewers to experience . danielle leneé a familiar face with delaware  stars as  in a fresh and funny turn. leneés  wants nothing more than to exist peacefully with the people she loves  and  however when denied she rises to the occasion with cleverness and seat of her pants plotting and produces schemes defying everyones expectations her own included. leneés charming performance allows  to take her turn as the butt of the joke without ever undercutting her intelligence. trevor  fayle counterbalances leneé as  matching her in charm but giving  a sweet openness. fayles portrayal of his infatuation with  and his willingness to imagine ganymede in her place is so sincere that their love at first sight seems immediately plausible. bi jean ngo meanwhile plays  with an amusing flightiness that never compromises her affection for or faithfulness to her cousin. the rest of the eight person cast takes on most of the responsibility for doubled roles allowing them to show off their range. j hernandez shifts from the uncompromising duke frederick to the jovial duke senior to a particularly funny  a yokel with some nevertheless sardonic insights. jeffrey cousar goes through similar alterations as well as expressing his characters own personal transformations his angry  changes into a penitent brother and a gentleman capable of love at first sight while his simpering  though perpetually lovesick grows the suggestion of a backbone and also busts out some sweet breakdance moves during in the springtime. merri rashoyan makes the most of multiple minor parts giving  a cocksure brashness  a delightfully dumb fascination with the bouncing tree boughs and  a determined and hilarious seductiveness. the entire cast possesses a cheerful amiability that serves the plays humor well. the trajectory of designer amanda wolffs modern dress costumes veers quickly away from the somber court dress duke frederick and s dark trousers and waistcoats  and s matching wrap style dresses in restrained light blue and heather grey into an explosion of color and patterns in the countryside. duke seniors merry band of exiles wear bright scarves and accessories with their smart fedoras  adds jade green overalls and  a purple skirt and matching kerchief overtop their respective outfits the shepherds and shepherdesses favor simpler garb but with pleasing details like the blue embroidery on s peasant blouse or the elaborately woven pattern on  poncho. wolff also does a nice job balancing the need for distinctive costumes with the actors need for quick changes when doubling parts having  wear s wrap skirt while rashoyan is busy playing  in the final scene is an amusing touch. david meyer head of the university of delawares sculpture area returns as the set designer. the minimal set dressing for the theater in the round setup consists largely of carved wooden stools and a table that doubles as the base for the sculptural trees that signify arden forest lovely metal outlines in a rainbow of colors that sway as if in the wind. props are few but the wire sculptures of glittering fruit provide a pop of color and emphasize the generosity of those in the forest. under director madeline sayets guidance the many moving pieces of doubled parts roaming actors and musical numbers effortlessly come together in their own dance. the pace is steady without being sluggish and the actors excel at keeping the tone lighthearted without sacrificing the authenticity of the characters. delawares local musiciancomposer joe trainor participates as ardens local musiciancomposer  augmenting his guitar with the ensembles own musical talents and adapting all of s songs in catchy arrangements that are over far too soon. as you like it exemplifies an archetypal an comedy featuring wise clowns mistaken identities minor class warfare and crossdressing. delaware  faithfully sticks to the spirit of the play even as it updates its outer trappings with modern dress and a cast that reflects american society. the result is a classic production that never feels underproduced   a fun interpretation for longtime fans and an excellent introduction for those who have never experienced  before.,4,Comedy,Positive
As You Like It,The PSF Goes into the Woods,Jennifer Kramer,for the pennsylvania  festivals production of as you like it director matt pfeiffer and the spirited witty cast offer a fresh take on its classic themes of love pastoral relaxation and musical theater. the production almost seems to delight in the ambiguity of the setting. the costumes by designer devon painter offer no hint to the time period   or rather they offer multiple conflicting hints. duke frederick wears a luxuriously spangled black velvet doublet and lace ruff and courtiers like lebeau and  follow suit with similarly renaissance inspired outfits.  and  meanwhile first appear in victorian ball gowns with bustles and black gloves. the forest of arden further complicates matters as  stomps around in ruffly dresses and cowboy boots while  matches brightly colored vests to his chuck taylor all stars. this is not to say that the costumes are not effective the only true misstep is s wedding dress and that because neither her floral top nor sequined skirt fit properly. overall the costumes exhibit a thematic unity where the somber blacks of duke fredericks court contrast with the bright colors patterns and floral motifs of the forest of arden and everyone embraces pastoral style as opposed to anything a practical shepherd would actually wear with glee. scenic designer brian sidney bembridges set likewise conveys no definite setting. it offers a minimalist suggestion of nature with wooden pillars bracketed by wrought iron frames standing in for trees and delicate glass lamps hanging from the ceiling substituting for stars. a highly polished wooden floor and looming decorative wooden screens in the wings complete the nature inspired but not actually naturalistic ambiance. the closest anyone comes to the actual countryside is sitting on the prop bale of hay. the cast is uniformly excellent. as  marnie schulenburg gives a hilarious performance that is not afraid to be awkward and weird clutching s undershirt like a handkerchief or getting carried away in her disguise as ganymede. schulenburg has excellent chemistry with stella baker  who is equally funny the two characters take turns being the sensible one with s emotional levelness compensating for s lovesickness and s practicality compensating for s lack of experience with the real world. zack robidas as  proves himself schulenburgs equal in amusing and endearing awkwardness. he gives  an aspirational charm that suggests that while  instinctively senses the world ought to work a certain way he has no idea how to accomplish it and as a result wanders rather far afield. the traditional love poems nailed to trees are supplemented by events such as playing the bandit and taking one of duke seniors men hostage   with a stick while incorrectly wearing a handkerchief over the top of his face. alexander sovronsky steals numerous scenes as  the musical leader of duke seniors merry men besides his admirable singing and playing he also provides an excellent foil for ian merrill peakes moody  rounding out their banter with gentle amusement. ilia paulino likewise lends her musical talents while playing a surprisingly canny  who doesnt seem as much taken in by the manipulations of  dan hodge as a willing participant who finds them amusing. hodge meanwhile successfully exploits a whole range of comic scenarios from the traditional an banter to stoner humor to some quick witted improv tequila shots taste best with lime so raise a glass to . director matt pfeiffer is known for his musical productions and as you like it   the most musical of s plays   is no exception. once again collaborating with composermusic directorsound designer alex bechtel the first half of the production showcases delightful acoustic settings of the plays music. the second half features a few adaptations of more contemporary music which while normally a staple of pfeiffer and bechtel seem to stick out more here. pfeiffer also combines the casts musical talents with their comedic ones as when  reprises  song for his own cynical lyrics while insisting on squeaking out the high notes or when esau pritchetts stately yet groovy duke senior crashes the post intermission overture with a glamorous saxophone solo. pfeiffer keeps the production moving at a steady pace moving events along while leaving plenty of time for jokes the comedy stays grounded in the characters charm. pfeiffer also manages to gently poke fun at the pastoral lifestyle of the arden forest residents while showing why they would turn to it. the court of duke frederick an appropriately unbalanced esau pritchett is a place of dark colors uncertainty and anxiety pfeiffers decision to insert the intermission after  completes the ranks of those who defect to arden is unusual but effective emphasizing the characters ability to relax and grow in their new environment. the result is well rounded well done and eminently enjoyable. the pennsylvania  theatres production of as you like it is faithful to the plays spirit and playful with its themes providing audiences with their own small escape to arden forest.,4,Comedy,Positive
As You Like It,A Merry Transformation in the Forest,Yuko Kurahashi,as you like it written sometime between 1588 and 1600 is one of the most beloved romantic comedies by .  used as its source

founder of the goodyear tire and rubber company. in this setting the performers lure the audience to the forest of arden and a romantic comedy with music songs dance stage combat and the magic. following its long tradition the osf performance presents a greenshow which starts half an hour before the curtain. dressed in green most of the performers in as you like it participate in the greenshow singing and dancing to traditional english and irish folk songs and original parodied songs. osfs green show which originally started with one song before the performance has evolved into a substantial part of the program preparing the audience to enjoy the main dish of the evening. as you like it is a comedy yet is poignant in portraying human beings who are consumed with greed jealousy and hatred. this is highlighted in as you like it in the contrast between the court and the woods where the characters ask existential questions about materialism vs. spirituality and life vs. death. the plays philosophical observation about the reality of transient life and humans blindness to it might be summarized in one of the famous  lines all the worlds a stage and all the men and women merely players 2.7. the play also introduces a woman character in male disguise and depicts the miraculous possibility of humans transformation from greedy to benevolent. ohio  festival theatricalizes these questions and transformations through its physical musical and audience participatory approach. the pre arden scenes before  her cousin  and the court jester  flee from the court and  with his eldest brothers servant  from their family home to the woods are used to establish the characters respective situations and circumstances. in the osfs production this exposition is spiced up by a wrestling match between  a court wrestler and  the youngest son of sir rowland de boys. joe pine as  shows off his masculine bare chest while  played by ryan zarecki tries to emulate him. a well choreographed fighting routine choreographed also by ryan zarecki includes  being flipped over to the floor by  several times until  finally throws  to the ground and jumps on him winning the match. zarecki as  actually jumps on the space next to pine as  using an entertaining and thrilling tactic common in professional wrestling matches. the forest of arden contrasts the court which is described by the banished duke senior described as the life of painted pomp it is ind with hatred deception and usurpation. of the many philosophers in as you like it the osf production focuses on two. one is the nature loving melancholic lord  performed by jeff knox and the other is  the shepherd performed by karen l. wood. knox dressed in all black like a prince  suffers from his self absorbed melancholia delivering his philosophical inquiries in a poetic manner. woods shepherd loves all creatures on earth including her ewes but does not care about good manners at the court a place which is ridiculous and unclean. wood draws a contrast between the court and the country while she and  are fishing emphasizing the shepherds life of tranquility and peace and patience.  gorells  who becomes befriended by both  and  demonstrates his wits and develops his own logic and reason against these philosophers. tess burglers  transforms from a plain lady the niece of duke frederick played by katie zarecki to a vivacious lad called ganymed with wits and strength in contrast to sara coons lady like . ryan zareckis  shows youthful charm in contrast to his eldest brother  played by dean coutris as an arrogant and ambitious head of the family. david mcnees portrays a likable duke senior who has experienced before the play begins his own transformation in the forest into a man who enjoys life without public haunt. trevor budas  and lara mielcareks  serve as a lower class counterpart to  and . the quartet of    and  in scene 1.2 provides one of the most musical and lively scenes in the show. the costumes designed by marty laconte have the shape and texture of elizabethan period costume in line with ohio  festivals commitment to staging s work within the style of the globe theatre. laconte avoids buttons hooks zippers and visible machine seams. lacontes choice of s black costume and s patchwork costume are particularly creative. ohio  theatre is also known for its use of direct address to the audience. about three quarters of dialogue and aside is addressed to the audience a technique that draws the audience into the story. while many of  productions by other theatre companies use direct address ohio  theatre is unique in their overt and dominant use of direct address. live music by accomplished musicians jason leupold guitar amy teagan dick harp  stoffer mandolin sydney keller guitar and karen wood flute adds merriment and festivity to the show. the last scene is the wedding of the four couples and coincides with the announcement of duke fredericks decision to renounce his title and wealth to become a hermit in the forest. this s the beginning of a new era with love and trust. the osf players celebrate with classical renaissance music arranged by  stoffer along with spirited dance. the show ends with the epilogue by  who first apologizes for its unconventionality a woman delivering an epilogue and states her intention to conjure cast a spell on the audience men and women alike so that they would love and take care of each other. s epilogue underscores the power of love and peace to overcome the destructive forces of greed hatred and

have the theaters offerings been some of the most inventive and enjoyable experiences the hudson valley has to offer but the play is also just a part of the full cultural experience. located on the historic grounds of boscobel a 19th century house and garden estate overlooking the lush and gorgeous hudson valley theatergoers are invited to enter the grounds two hours before the show to enjoy the vast and inviting lawn a café filled with food from local businesses and jaw dropping vistas that overlook west point and the hudson highlands. so several groups tend to take advantage of the offer and allow themselves to lounge and engage with the surroundings wandering the gardens and picnicking on the grounds thus setting the tone and mindset for what awaits. like the main characters of the play who are banished to the forest because of city based corruption and find themselves renewed and recentered as a result of immersion in the wilderness and natural surroundings so are the theatergoers who frolic on the grounds retreating away from the hustle of daily life. the hvsf twelve week season traditionally includes two well chosen  plays along with an additional non an and sometimes original choice all housed in a beautifully lit open air theater tent with stadium style seating. for the theaters anniversary this season offers three  plays that include  measure for measure and as you like it. differentiating themselves in the vast summer  festival landscape the troupe takes a page from the recent trend in  theater and has developed their  with an all female cast showcasing only three actresses. although used sparingly throughout the years this all female trend has been recently popularized by st. anns warehouse in brooklyn with their productions of   and henry iv and the public theaters recent taming of the shrew. however hvsfs risks in generating female driven theater through clever means is the  of a theater never content with standardized staging one willing to take deep risks that clearly reveal a strong love of the material and the man behind the drama. for the hudson valley  festival you can see the visionary work in the variety of off kilter and non traditional approaches in so many decisions contributing to the formation of their productions but its as you like its brilliant attention to the dissection of human relationships and an empathetic understanding of human need that reflect their brilliance not only as an interpreters but also as individuals who have closely studied the human condition and have chosen to juxtapose our cultural understanding on top of it. written in 1599 just barely pre dating s prolific period the play hasnt always been seen as a masterpiece. with an excess of spoken exposition events that are somewhat too agreeable an apparent lack of a true fool and a conclusion thats just a bit too tidy its a not exactly a problem play but it does have its issues. that this production makes you forget about all of those issues is a testament to how well the audience is transported to their realm where lovers are pursued and wit is sharpened. set in the forest of arden the audience feels as if we are in the forest along with the actors as the surroundings contribute to said transportation. the magnificence of the grounds is utilized as a natural extension of the upstage area and actors entrances and exits can be seen as far as fifty yards away making movements grand and actions harrowing and ominous. when we first see  and the masked party guests entering from afar we sense trouble afoot. when we watch  shouting his desires name aloud and running through the fields we feel the depth of his innocence and devotion. it really is a great use of the area especially well chosen for this plays sense of place. with a sparse open round filled with dirt sand and little to no set dressing the reliance for place then turns to what actors can physically bring to the area. so a white stripe baseball field er turns the area into an immediate wrestling ring a few logs and a prop campfire transform into duke seniors private camp a rolling piano and a string of lights make for a carnival like setting. props and pieces whir in and out as we are thrown from one place to the next almost without warning. clever casting replays the effect as sudden onstage donning of costumes draw from the same whiz bang effect. its theater of the mind and hvsf gleefully pokes and prods at it. however what truly sets the production values apart from most is the directors and crews decision to tie costume and music not to a specific place but to individual characters. at some point someone realized that these characters are so distinct that their looks and musical choices should transcend genre and be linked to arc and motivation. hence cast members sing southern blues and songs that evoke slavery dressing like robin hoods merry men by way of an armynavy surplus stores patchwork quilt. bass booms and actors rap dancing about like a rihanna dance troupe as the play draws to an exciting conclusion. and a priest dressed as elvis flies in on a golf cart wedding chapel to highlight the hastiness of an impending marriage. trombones blare pianos groove harmonicas hum guitars strum and kazoos buzz. and thats not even mentioning the goofball hayseed sensibility that pervades every scene with  and  working like a comedic deliverance or s wild colors seizure inducing prints and overdone makeup that make him resemble a batman villain. sure they reveal his comical foolish arrogance but the added layers show that hes still the smartest man in the room and highlight actor  bedards natural ease and familiarity with the language and at getting a laugh. every choice made here in costume prop set piece makeup and so on adds a multitude of layers to each character granting great depth to the smallest of roles. the entire production although stripped down is a feast for the eyes as well as the ears. with such careful planning to production a strong supporting cast and a central focus on the main love story the two leads are given numerous moments to put their talents to good use. julia cofffey who recently joined the production is a standout as  playing her endearingly plucky and happy go lucky she emerges as an adorable force of nature who has a greater grasp on human relationships than we first think. when we first catch sight of her she is breaking down in sobs over her banished father and ms. coffeys emotive gestures project a weakened spirit. however as she deftly manipulates  to her will while convincingly spouting such sage wisdom as men are april when they woo december when they wed and juggling four different relationship outcomes under such misfortune we see not just how strong a woman she is but how strong a person. ms. coffeys performance oversteps gender and embraces humanity. a great foil to her  leroy mcclain as  is able to handle quite a range of emotions working from dishonored son to vicious fighter to schoolyard boy with a crush in a matter of minutes changing from one emotion and back again on a dime. the audience will try to put mcclains  into a neat little box but the actor refuses to be contained to one raging in anger one minute and flirting with giggles the next. and when  and  first lay eyes on each other there is palpable heat and sparks. the chemistry between the two actors makes you root for them the entirety of the play firmly grounding the audience in their love story. its a tribute to the director gaye taylor upchurch who instead of allowing the audience to become too awash in the spectacle emphasizes the small moments of kindness and human connection to show where the plays true heart beats. in addition to when the main lovers initial meet when duke senior invites  almost at deaths door from lack of food and water to partake in the camps meager accommodations as the banished gently nurse him back to health its in these moments where we glimpse s understanding of man. when a disguised  is wooed by an unknowing  and rhetoric around the mystery of romantic relationships is laid bare s commentary on the nature of love is revealed and upchurch wisely quiets the production to let the audience linger on these moments. part college philosophy course vaudevillian stage show southern gospel confessional and depression era travelogue its the directors clear vision that makes this production such a strong mix of disparate elements. through this juxtaposition and approach the production is over the top when it needs to be introspective and clever at just the right points loud and brash when called to be and passionate and moving when it should be. sure it all ties up just a little too neatly at the end as we expected it would but with this production and cast we are too distracted by all the right things to care. correction 080816 the review incorrectly described

As You Like It,Laughter Sans Intermission at the Lantern's As You Like It,Jennifer Kramer,the lantern theater companys production of as you like it seems presciently timed. besides opening the famously pastoral play in the spring season when the audience easily identifies with the characters shivering in the winter winds before rejoicing in the returning mild weather director  mcmahon uses lobby displays and program notes to highlight the context of the plays original release. england in 1599 during the political instability of the latter years of elizabeth is reign has a certain resonance with the planned but still unsettling political turmoil of the american electoral cycle. these echoes add depth to the production yet mcmahon never allows them to drown out the comedy. in this production even relatively minor roles maximize their humorous potential and the double casting allows the company to stretch their talents musical dramatic and comedic. meghan winch does a fine job of playing two uniquely odd and amorous shepherdesses in  and . chris  shines as  the wrestler with an over the top confidence a penchant for gleefully pile driving his opponents and some intensely emotional acting   ranging from nonchalance to rage   conveyed only through eating an apple. the roles of frank x meanwhile provide their own metatextual commentary. he adds a welcome pathos to the play as  s elderly servant and this sensitive portrayal sharply contrasts with his entertaining turn as  melancholy by way of sarcasm and decadent ennui. the two are tied together by the all the worlds a stage speech as the talented actor who played the elderly man now plays the wit acting out his musings on man acting out his life roles   ending of course with an elderly man. as for the main cast j hernandez makes  inscrutable but demonstrably off kilter and takes advantage of the fools creative grasp on reality to ad lib asides accusing the audience of stealing his luggage and exclaiming his hatred for sheep.  in this production does not exactly possess a mystic inherent gentility despite his rude upbringing he is every inch a rube albeit one who is aware he has been denied social education. but jake blouch imbues him with humor and charm because of his moments of awkwardness and cluelessness not in spite of them and lets  evolve into an oddball who is comfortable in his own skin. liz filios  undergoes a similar evolution the meet cute with  is a hysterical failure of social interaction on both sides and her melancholic cello playing and distinct guardedness around duke frederick show a difficulty in healthily expressing her emotions. but filios portrays s schemes in arden forest as a voyage of self discovery exploiting the freedom of her new identity to process her new feelings for  and her old feelings for her father on her own terms in the end she is most comfortable as a synthesis of her two old identities a princess in a fancy dress who spits on her hand to seal the bargain of her marriage to . however the comedic and emotional center of the production is ultimately the relationship between  and  ruby wolf a funny and endearing mix of mockery physical altercations and most of all affection. wolf portrays  as the inverse of her father duke frederick with all his emotional intensity but none of his vindictiveness simultaneously high strung and good natured deeply devoted to her cousin but more than willing to poke at s flaws. filios in turn makes it clear that though  seems more even tempered she feels her feelings just as deeply and in fredericks repressed court  is almost her only outlet for expression. wolf makes s protestations at  doubting her love or her exhortations for  to be happy not so much accusations as an instinctual frustration with the feelings  struggles with. while filios and wolf make the journey to the forest of arden humorously fraught for the two out of place city dwellers they eventually reveal that their characters instincts to leave were correct. by adopting new identities together  and  are counterintuitively able to be themselves and grow from a tight co dependence to a more healthy dynamic of mutual support. janus stefanowiczs costume design offers a nicely restrained commentary on the themes of the play. the setting is deliberately vague but definitely in the past with influences ranging from the antebellum to interbellum eras. the clothing of duke fredericks court is somber and subdued with formal suits and dresses heavy outerwear top hats and military style coats the colors run the spectrum from light grey to dark grey with some olive drab navy blue and black thrown in for visual flare. the inhabitants of the forest of arden meanwhile focus more on the interplay between practicality and personality besides multiple layers for warmth and heavy denim for sturdiness exiled courtiers and shepherds alike have a fondness for a whole array of unique colors textures and cuts. even  whose striped trousers and brightly colored patchwork jacket already stood out from the stuffy court takes advantage of the freedom of the countryside by ditching his boots and unearthing a pair of extremely drop crotched sirwal pants. the only obvious misstep is s wedding gown of a beautiful coral color but an unfortunate modern bridesmaid cut. the set by scenic designer meghan jones is airy and open with a series of round arches in white wood and a stepped gray stone dais upstage. the gray carpet brick red spandrels and fluttering gold banners do an admirable job translating the grand yet impersonal and empty nature of duke fredericks court. the blatant architectural features make it somewhat less successful as an approximation of arden forest even with the addition of some rustic stumps as the main set dressing however the green stone floor open framework and general pleasantness do at least nod to the freedom of nature. mcmahons lively direction strikes an excellent balance between the plays central themes and the sheer fun of its comedy. very little of the play is cut aside from some parts trimmed for the small cast. a few characters fail to make a reappearance   when their actors are otherwise occupied or amusingly in the case of  when mcmahon seems to have taken her a good play needs no epilogue at her word. mcmahon allows the natural wit and humor of the characters to bubble out of the repressive nature of duke fredericks court and gently emphasizes the emotional stakes of the amorous shenanigans amidst the farcical developments in arden forest. his treatment of the fight between  and  is a joy to behold mixing a more realistic take on how an amateur would fair against a professional fighter despite winning poorly the emotional engagement of both  witnessing a brutal beatdown and the audience realizing that s roundabout assassination could work all too well and the inherent humor of the contrast between  exuberance and s entirely justified yet hilarious shrieks of terror. mcmahon and composersound designer michael hahn also make music a key element of the production with a similar evolution. the production opens with a wordless chorus accompanied by a mournful cello an ominous avant garde style introduction to the atmosphere of court life where  and  latter attempt and abandon a classical inspired duet on violin and cello. in arden forest meanwhile the minor key of the music is counteracted by its energetic folk style and unapologetic instrumentation  inevitably acquires a tambourine while  trades her violin for a banjo. the production ends with a rousing reprise of the song from 5.3 which turns into a duet between  and  on   as heartwarming and proudly hokey as the characters themselves   guitar and accordion. though mcmahon does not shy away from the serious implications of either the play or contemporary society the productions message is ultimately one of hope by being true to themselves the characters heal their broken state. the lanterns as you like it champions the worthiness of optimism and self discovery and reminds us that despite the darkest of circumstances there is always time for humor.,5,Comedy,Positive
As You Like It,Shrewds Apply 21st-Century Gender Practices in a Fanciful As You Like It in Austin,Michael Meigs,this is a land of dreams enchanted and enchanting. as you like it is always fun and this version by austins shrewd productions is something special. director lily wolff draws into this magic circle both familiar austin devotees of  performance and attractive newcomers. and the shrewd company is just that knowledgeable confident plausible and entirely winning. set initially in the court of an irascible and usurping duke its a quick moving tale of women friends escape to the forest of arden where adventure and romance await. young ducal heiress  wants nothing more to do with her glowering and potentially violent father who has driven out his brother the former ruler and now is banishing s bff . fleeing in the company of  the fool theyll settle in a rustic farmhouse in the forest and their improbable disguises will fool s father duke sr. and the band of followers as well as the handsome but penniless outcast . and yes this is the one where love struck  pretends to be a young page disguising himself as  to teach love struck  how to overcome his infatuation   with .  sets us up with couples galore in the shadowy woods nobles and rustics bosom friends and yearning lovers. as you like it is a happy primer on proper behavior and there are comic lessons to be learned by many. were captivated by the characters and the comic dénouement provides love matches reconciliations and happily ever afters. theres lots of hugging and kissing. the publicity for this production has promised surprises of gender bending perhaps leading folks to expect burlesque or vaudeville. not a whit of it. true to the original and essentially verbatim in text this as you like it proves nimble articulate and wonderfully funny a comedy based in well intentioned guile and character. what director wolff has done is simply to wave a wand and declare that the gender of the actor doesnt necessarily have to be that of the character. that expands potential roles for actresses   fritz ketchum as the welcoming banished duke sr. for example andreá smith as the haughty older brother  who threatens  molly fonseca as the melancholy jacques and julie moore as  the clown. but the transformation moves in the opposite direction as well to fine comic effect when david boss doubles both as the wicked duke jr. and as simple  the shepherdess who falls madly in love with . the convention is easy to accept and forget. after all s women were originally played by teenage males. no quibbles are required especially not in view of these casting choices. the shrewds secured the trinity street players snug black box theatre on the fourth floor of first baptist church at 901 trinity street in downtown austin but they dont start there. heralds played by taylor flanagan and taji senior gipson marshal spectators at the outdoor courtyard to hear young s laments and his rebuke by firstborn brother . the company and audience move inside for scenes at the dukes court played on the lower staircases and in the enormous central well of first baptist with the audience looking down from ground floor to basement level for the wrestling match. young  caring nothing for his own life takes on  the champion and his desperate valor makes  fall in love with him. the audience moves upstairs to the forest of arden in the theatre lit with muted colors and hung with narrow thin purple gauze strips representing the trees of the dense wood. this ingenious concept is sustained by patrick s lighting design. the company and scenic consultant b.p. houle made the vexatious choice to populate the stage fully with those free hanging representative trees rather than creating a central clearing. this gives the company plenty of opportunities for business with gauze fabric but regularly obscures the action. the artistic effect is to accentuate the mystery and obscurity of this magic locale but the practical effect is consistent blocking of sightlines. because its a small space and the players are constantly in movement the design decision is annoying but not fatal. kriston woodreaux is a tall beau hunk of a man. his  the earnest lover is determined muscularly gentle and perceptive the archetype of the handsome young man ready to be taught to have bold heart to win fair maid. his  shannon grounds has been here before for she was  in beth burns 2009 as you like it at the scottish rite theatre in austin. her portrayal of  is fresh and exuberant. robin grace thompson as her buddy  is more grounded but consistently supportive. a word for the clowns robert deike as feeble old servant  and as confused clergyman sir   uses his familiar broadly comic style to caricature those minor characters. julie moore as  is a coxcombed delight strutting and bragging and moores wooing of the hairy chested boss as  is right over the top and beyond. molly fonseca is a pensive jacques but not in the least sour in expression and movement she establishes a quiet ascetic distance from the antics of all these signiors love. t. lynn mikeskas settings of s words are lyric and light hearted whether for solos or for celebrating chorus. diction delivery movement and intent are crystal clear throughout and theres not a second of downtime. the shrewds as you like it does the piece proud and its an enchantment to be cherished. extra click to go to vimeo.com and view shrewd productions two minute promotional video by jose lozano of magic spoon productions,4,Comedy,Positive
As You Like It,A Woman's World,Kurt Daw,if this season is the year of the woman among bay area  festivals then surely the livermore  festival with its female leadership team artistic director lisa a. tromovitch managing director katie marcel deserves particular notice. although they have done nothing to draw particular attention to it it is worth observing that this summer the festival has an all female directing staff tromovitch and long time company member jennifer le blanc and a female centered repertoire sense and sensibility as you like it. [note managing director katie marcel has pointed out that although she describes it as a matter of chance and not design the board of directors is also all female.] the company is certainly on the move. tromovitch is the recently elected president of the international  theatre association and has worked steadily to raise the profile and professionalism of her company over the last five years including a change for this season to wente vinyards as a performance venue. that new venue provides the key to tromovitchs production of as you like it. performed on an elevated platform with essentially no scenery and completely surrounded by the audience the opening night performance had an unforced rapport between the performers and the audience reminiscent of the original conditions for an performances. the audience was very close and never treated as if they were in a separate space. it helped a lot that no matter where you sat audience members were in your direct line of sight across the stage from you. actors freely passed through the audience for all entrances and those not currently onstage frequently popped into empty seats here and there to watch the show with us. the resulting casual tone was perfect for just knocking back and enjoying the show aided by the fact that nearly everyone there was enjoying a glass of wine while they watched. the comfort and ease of the audience interaction was a stark contrast to most  indeed most theatre that i see where the audience is strongly controlled and subtly intimidated. here it was easy to forget that you were watching a four hundred year old play by the greatest writer that ever lived. it felt as easy going and enjoyable as a community picnic. tromovitchs take on the show was essentially conservative with period ish costumes with a folk flavor designed by barbara murray although she did adopt a very original approach to the dramaturgically troubled ending of the show that surprised and delighted. her point however was not to comment on the show but to fulfill it. thanks to leading lady maryssa wanlass it was the most emotionally present and engaging ayli i have seen in some time. her chemistry with joseph salazar as  was as fresh and delightful as that of the latest summer rom com. as you like it is a popular favorite among s comedies but is in fact fiendishly difficult to get right. it employs the most music of any  play has a rather unfocused meandering plot and typically ends with a literal and essentially unexplained deus ex machina in which the god  arrives to set things right an incident treated so casually that one might assume these characters just interact with gods daily. things can and often do go wrong on all three fronts. tromovitch tackles all three of these challenges with a single unifying device the continual foregrounding of singer sean patrick nill as a kind of metatheatrical narrator. in his hands often accompanied by other cast members vocally and on instruments the music is aesthetically engaging while used to tie the story together. when he subsumed the role of  at the plays end   because he had seemingly been manipulating the story from slightly outside and above the play all evening it for once made sense the plot is complicated a dispossessed young man  falls in love with the beautiful niece of his corrupt duke but is so green and awkward he falls back on clichéd love poems to woo her. the niece  is herself forced to flee from her uncle who usurped the crown from her father. to protect herself she goes into exile disguised as a man. they meet again in the woods where both have fled.  does not recognize her through her male disguise but agrees to some tutoring from her in her male persona during which she will imitate his beloved for him in a role playing exercise. at the center of the play is a scene in which in the original a boy actor playing a woman who is disguised as a man pretends to be a woman in fact herself in order to teach her leading man how to be more genuine and assertive. it is a feat of real skill to keep all these levels clear especially when the characters get them confused. tromovitch handled this scene as cleverly as i have ever seen it with salazars befuddled  becoming increasingly confused about who exactly he is falling in love with the girl or the boy. things work out predictably for the couple and for several other couples that provide variations on the theme in a series of related subplots but not until the inevitable ending has been delayed as long as possible by the loose diversions found in a summer paradise. it takes a lot of work to make this all happen but tromovitch achieves it all with such a light touch that her direction is essentially invisible. looking back the engaging evening flew past but felt as indulgent as a chocolate truffle. strong performances from patrick  jones as s reforming older brother  j. wolak as his faithful servant and lindsey marie schmeltzer as an overly proud local yokel who falls in love with s male alter ego proved high points. the cast was not universally strong which showed particularly in some unconvincing doublings that were neither executed with versatility on their own terms nor justified in their undisguised reuse of actors by a performance convention. also as is often the case some of the more dated farcical parts of the play that have lost their point over time became strained searching for a laugh. the performance had far more strengths than weaknesses however. it was a perfect match of venue and play a light midsummer comedy in an intimate casual park like setting. only the hardest of hearts could possibly resist the swift and glorious ending. perhaps it is assuming too much to think that the marvelous sympathy between directorial approach and the leading actress strengths has anything to do with their shared gender. maybe it is just tromovitchs directorial skills and not her particular insights into this woman focused play that get the tone of this intricate comedy so right. conceivably the particularly invitational friendly environment established in the new venue is the product of good audience engagement research and has nothing to do with the sensibilities of an all female management team. it is worth contemplating however whether more than coincidence is at work. lets keep our eye on livermore  festival to see if womens leadership continues to provide unique results,4,Comedy,Positive
As You Like It,"Drums, Cymbals, and Sight Gags Abound",Cynthia Greenwood,s as you like it is a loquacious pastoral comedy that follows a predictable choreographic pattern unique within the authors canon of elizabethan comedies. throughout most of the plays short swiftly executed scenes the playwright allows any given pair of characters to converse with one another downstage while one or more stand upstage to watch and listen. unlike in twelfth night and cymbeline where  uses the exile motif as a device to engineer the suffering and subsequent triumph of  and imogen in as you like it the playwright employs exile as a conceit to situate his courtiers amid the shepherds and rustics in the forest of arden. there they ponder the vagaries of love and marriage as well as the merits of life within a highly civilized court versus the advantages of a quieter existence in the bucolic environs of the forest. in the alley theaters first foray into an comedy since scott schwartz directed much ado about nothing in 2006 artistic director  boyd turns s pastoral meditation on civilization and nature into a two and a half hour litany of sight gags and kooky sound effects. during the shows first half thundering drums and crashing cymbals signal every scene change and there are many of these presumably orchestrated to heighten the visual jokes that we the audience must be provided because we are assumed to be incapable of digesting the poetry of the worlds greatest playwright. to ensure that we will find humor in all the right moments   as well as in moments where  intended no humor at all   boyd relies on superfluous sound effects much as tv producers have used the dreaded laugh track since the 1950s. boyd seems to be convinced that in 2015 in the fourth largest metropolitan area in the united states  cannot be relied upon to stand on his own. this is unfortunate because the alley employs a formidable group of players who have performed  impressively under schwartzs past direction. james black a veteran actor and occasional director is well cast as  the melancholy philosopher. with his magnificently consistent performance he imbues his scenes in the forest of arden with the gravitas that  must have envisioned. playing  the fool veteran alley artist jeffrey bean is equally robust employing a deft comic touch in scenes with  the homely goatherd whom he courts. in early scenes within duke fredericks court and during the famed epilogue elizabeth bunch is nicely poised as  the plays central cross dressing heroine. but disguised as the boy ganymede bunch is much less inspiring given to sawing the air while imparting her lessons in love to  with whom she is smitten. in the role of  chris hutchison has excellent moments but i would have enjoyed seeing him interpret this role without boyds ham handed direction. playing s cousin  emily trask offers some refreshing diversion while singing under the greenwood tree the plays signature ditty. seasoned alley actor todd waite lends refreshing depth and breadth to the roles of the villain duke frederick and the exiled duke  the brother whose dukedom frederick usurps. no matter how hard boyd and his cast pander to a houston audience whom they perceive to be illiterate about all things an we get glimpses of the rich poetic nuance of this talky play. the sets and costumes cleverly imagined to maximize the plays elizabethan provenance remind us of the alleys serious commitment to high quality production values. within the milieu of duke fredericks court the men sport doublet and hose while the women wear sixteenth century era gowns with stunning black and white designs of vivid stripes and diagonal patterns. while the alley theatre undergoes a 46.5 million renovation to its home in downtown houston the company will perform all 2014 15 productions at the university of houstons wortham theatre. the 565 seat theatre has a well appointed stately lobbyreception area and the auditorium feels hardly used. the alleys temporary home at uh appears to be a great choice as the audience turnout for as you like it on opening night appeared strong. the alley theatre performs s as you like it through february 22 2015 at the uh wortham theatre on the uh campus. parking is free and located in the large student lot across from the universitys fine arts complex and moores opera center.,4,Comedy,Positive
As You Like It,"Something New, Something Old",Melissa Crismon,a stylized musical with whimsical characters intermittently breaking out in a jig esque dance  the old globes production of as you like

in his words full of love wonderful characters and no less than four weddings at the plays end. sometimes this play is produced with a dark tone but noble balances the melancholy with humor and fun. as you like it is especially entertaining with jacques c. smith  as a big talker balancing the sexual and comic prose with a sarcastic melancholy.  is in the forest with the lords who maintain their loyalty to the banished duke listening to the mandolin. he says he  can suck the melancholy out of a song as a weasel sucks eggs in an off putting way to  daveline . daveline  tells smith  he cannot please him. smith wittingly quips back i do not desire you to please me. he draws out many other lines like this using tail as a pun. then there is the famous line all the worlds a stage  he speaks of the seven ages of man accenting sans teeth sans eyes sans taste sans everything. his words set up a visually stunning entrance as dan amboyer  carries in  janasz  to the s table of food. the cast is made mute by the speech and after moves silently in slow motion offering a picturesque view. dana green  is infectiously sanguine and dan amboyer  is too smitten to give in to s temperamental attitude. green almost forgets she is ganymede as she holds amboyer from behind sitting on the floor. amboyer is a willing  wooing ganymede if that is what it takes to satisfy his affection for . amboyer lies next to ganymede with his head on vivia fonts  bottom and then slaps it. green uses her scarf as a prop and covers them with it as she curls around him pretending to be his love. green has the audience convinced she is a woman in love who has possibly given her identity away. font saves her from revealing the truth too soon by being a playful assistant. green lies on font crying trying to convince  not to go. its a fun girlish friendship.  has more than one admirer. allison spratt pearce phoebe is giddily naughty as she has to have ganymede no matter what. she holds a shepherds rod between her legs bouncing not able to contain her lust. all the while her true admirer christopher salazar  is watching as she makes a fool of herself lying on the floor wanting ganymede. some of the creative team that worked on as you like it also worked in last years festival include scenic designer ralph funicello costume designer deirdre clancy and composer shaun davey. they tweaked similar ideas from the previous year which gives each of them as an artist an expectant signature style. the impressively crafted stage starts out as almost empty with two ladders leading up to the rafters. though minimalist the props are dramatic by using a similar sheet that overwhelms the stage in last years the tempest. the sheet lies on the stage with holes for newly centered ladders. the cast stands among the audience and pulls the ropes that elevate the white cloth tilting it creating a faux roof. another clever prop creates snow by having white felt creep along the stage behind   and  upon entering the forest of arden. for the fight scene a scaled down fighting ring is raised through the trap leaving an impression in the middle of the stage allowing for  and  to continue their scene sitting behind the ropes with their legs dangling as they sit in sparkling dresses. how apropos to have the most memorable staged scene be the all the worlds a stage  the cast is cozy in winter clothes enjoying plates of fruit and bread with light fading around them like a painting set by lighting designer alan burrett. the production starts with pre recorded harp joined with a drum. also  daveline  plays a mandolin evocative of irish america. composer davey had used the harp in the tempest last year but this time around is folk inspired. the cast joins in for many catchy tunes such as with a hey and a ho and a hey nonino. the music inspires dance taking the audience back to appalachia. this year the old globes as you like it doesnt disappoint with some of the same made new through the creative team and some returning and new cast. its comforting to see familiar faces like jay whittaker  who is also cast as richard in richard iii and to see actors like allison spratt pearce grow and transform and  janasz  become the indiscernible actor. the actors dissolve into their character forcing a discerning eye to look at headshots to make sure that is who is on stage. dan amboyer is a new flawless  adding to the optimism of this production. the old globes creation is less melancholy and more cheery as romance and optimistic philosophy of the youth prevail. adrian nobles direction is inspiring allowing all the senses to be stroked. he never disappoints with a sophisticated show. there is something for everybody whether it is a play or a musical  it can

 production in one of the many protest camps that have sprung up all over the world. this is what is happening in london at the white bear theatre in london where independent director nna vogt has assembled a cast and put on a credible production of as you like it which runs for five days up to 29 january. as you like it contains one of s most bizarre and irrational plots and it is always a challenge to convey the various plot threads and keep the audience engaged. the plays absurdity plus the eccentric characters are what gives the play its charm and the audience has to suspend belief to enter anyones vision of arden. vogt even writes at least in midsummer magic is a plot device which shows the challenge directors face. firstly it has to be said vogts vision of equating the occupy london camp which sits on the steps of st pauls cathedral to the forest of arden is poorly executed. there are some interesting and clear parallels between the two places worthy of exploration but this potential is not realised. both arden the occupy camp juxtapose the order and rules of their relative established worlds with a leaderless and semi wild alternative. both places are havens for the dispossessed and the idealists who have been thrown together and they both have an eclectic madness with music performance and an overtly anti establishment liberal attitude. however this production doesnt quite get it right. a large tent sits bizarrely on the side of the stage and has no part in the production it even blocked some of the audiences view and without the painted london skyline you could be anywhere. there were no other props or apparel to  it as occupy london and apart from the token handing out of leaflets to the audience the concept didnt come across at all. some decoration such as posters or anti capitalist banners would have made the setting more apparent and added to the atmosphere of what was a very empty stage. this is not a major problem as it does not detract from the overall experience but the setting is pushed heavily in all the materials director notes etc so it would have been preferable if as much effort were spent here as on the performances. for those in need of refreshment the story can be cut in to two main plot threads. the first story is that of  clare langford the daughter of the deposed duke senior yvonne riley who flees from court and chooses to disguise herself as a young man called ganymede to live in the forest of arden. she is accompanied by her cousin  gabriella curtis whose own father frederick jeryl burgess took over the duchy and who banishes them both.  is already in love with  will wheeler main protagonist of the second story after seeing him beat the dukes preferred wrestler. he is in open conflict with his brother  ryan wichert who was supposed to be his guardian.  feels let down and flees to the forest after learning  intends to have him killed. after meeting the various wenches shepherds and her father who live in the forest with their own dramas and love stories  is made aware of s presence in the forest and disguised still as ganymede greets him and tries to cure him of his love for . she does this all still wearing her disguise. on the side stories  and s co traveler  daniel yabut has fallen in love with a local called  kim maloney and plans to get married. there is also the story of phoebe kate bancroft a local girl who is in love with ganymede but is loved by  jeffrey ho.  presumably maddened by love now tries to woo ganymede as in his head he has become  who of course is ganymedes real identity. amidst the confusion  appears in the forest and meets with  and . he recounts a tale of how  saved him from a lion as he walked through the forest but was injured. in the process he and  take a liking to each other and fall in love. to resolve all of this ganymede gathers everyone and orders them to be married. she tells   will appear at the wedding and phoebe and  will be married as ganymede will no longer be around. at the wedding ganymede is revealed to be  and all the couples are married by  one of the gods that lives in the forest. it is revealed that duke frederick has converted and become a monk therefore handing the duchy back to senior who can return from arden. throughout the play there are substantial jumps in the plot but the characters are vivid and well performed. in the beginning wheelers  is nervous and stays rooted to the spot far too often but as the play develops he becomes very accomplished and funny as the love sick gentleman. the dialogue between  and  at the start seems forced overly intimate and with too much emphasis on physical actions and exaggerated expressions but again both improve drastically as the play goes on. saying this langford is an exceptional actress and is brilliant at the end especially with the way she masters the epilogue. she and wheeler have a natural chemistry which makes their love convincing but funny at the same time. wheeler excels with the lovelorn element of his character and provides much of the humour. with as you like it it is a challenge to differentiate the performances among the various couples but vogt manages to tease the best out of her characters individual quirks. yabut as  is fantastic his delivery and acrobatics dominate the stage and he is matched with a very feisty   they are by far the most physical of the couples. s role only develops late in the play and does the quiet in love well with sighs slow delivery and flirtation. wichert has probably the hardest role as he has to accurately convince the audience he converts from scheming elder brother to kind and caring with no explanation. wichert fails in this respect and his sudden love for  doesnt fully ring true. regarding the other characters the overall funniest pairing is jeffrey yus performance as . his overdone accent and childish manner are brilliant to watch and partnered with the brilliant kate bancroft as phoebe their energy and pace keep up peoples interest in these side plots which vogt successfully integrates into the main  and  thread. despite setting it in an overtly political arena some areas of the plays political subtext are less explored. the famed religious satire is semi disregarded. other subtexts are fully played up such as the close relationship between  and . the political intrigue and the mistrust are glossed over in favour of the love story. the role of the dukes played by women is minimised as vogt focuses on the stronger parts of the text and succeeds in creating a surrealist and absurd love story. the lighting designed by brian merry makes effective use of what is available the white bear theatre is in the rear of a pub with dimming and spots used to full effect. the costumes are all modern dress the only real way the actors allude to the occupy camp and the contrast between the main casts scruffy student esque clothes and denim with the formal suits worn by those in the court is quite effective in showing the contrast between arden and the civilised world. as mentioned above there are many things the production could have done to decorate the space better and it seems a shame that the space is not used more creatively. where the production excels is in the use of music and the way the actors interact with the audience and props. rather than use a cd deck a backing track is played by owen nolan who also appears as the shepherd  on an acoustic guitar. the various other songs are performed with flutes and song and the natural live music adds much atmosphere. this play would have been better off not being sold as  meets occupy as the production does not do enough to create the link. some further decoration and a clearer highlighting of the plays political subtext could have created more pointed drama matching the energy and the fun of the performances. despite this vogt makes a memorable production especially in the creative playing of the epilogue after the curtain call.,3,Comedy,Negative
As You Like It,Texas State: The Cool Blue Twilight of As You Like It,Michael Meigs,eta fantovas designs for as you like it at texas state university establish at a glance the intentions of director chuck ney. the action opens at duke fredericks court a bare space at the front of the wide thrust stage bounded to the rear by a high chill wall with a blue metallic sheen. that wall initially appears featureless except for the edifice of steel tubing and dark metal treads parked against it    the sort of movable ladder one might expect to find in a warehouse. concealed doors open from that blank wall including one at the top of the edifice. characters descend or climb those precarious stairs that sway suggesting a subtle danger. the court is equally bare and cold. young  is angered by the neglect shown to him by his elder inheriting brother . duke frederick the ominous usurping head of this city state stalks onstage accompanied by bodyguards whose chief function is to walk and stalk in step with him. when the dukes daughter  and her banished best girl friend  flee to the forest the metal barrier wall vanishes to reveal a striking deep stage picture very similar to that depicted on the poster for this production. fantova has established progressive inclines running from side to side of the stage usable as steps or as ramps and she uses tall narrow glowing cylinders of white semi lucent fabric to suggest the trees of a grove perhaps of birches. exiled duke senior speaks to his band of the icy fang and the churlish chiding of the winters wind but their white and blue world suggested merely feels far warmer than that of the court. director chuck ney chooses to situate this production in the present day. that interpretation opens opportunities particularly musical ones. among exiled duke seniors men are a number of nimble fingered strolling guitarists. wry jacques the philosopher of the exiled band is a sinewy aged man who elicits a rhythmic blues riff from the dukes acoustic guitarist for his ducdame satire of under the greenwood tree. the celebration of the deer hunt in iv 2 is a haunting a capella rendition in the twilight of what shall he have that killd the deer much in the style of seattles fleet foxes. members of the wandering band do a lover and his lass with guitar and improvised percussion like street busking music and sean mcgibbon performs break dancing with the energy and assurance of competition level gymnastics. the final celebratory dance is a memorable cross between a contra dance and a hoedown. at some corners however this smoothly woven fairy tale catches on the contemporary concepts and comes close to ripping. duke seniors supporters are labeled homeless lords but theyre young clean amused and bursting with health a bit like explorer scouts out for a long weekend in tennessees great smoky mountains. the wrestling match between the dukes champion  and young  is swift and dramatic but fight coordinator paul schimmelman makes it look like a world wrestling entertainment bout complete with rabbit punches and kidney jabs forfeiting the opportunity to establish  as naive or ethical. the final scene in the palace iii 1 converts duke fredericks brief interrogation of  into a nasty scene of torture. minions wear black ninja masks and repeatedly force the prisoners head into a bucket.  twitches and bubbles loudly until with a flick of his hand the duke signals a respite.  emerges gasping and wet. its a grim amnesty international moment one that disturbs without particularly contributing to the play. texas state university just 35 miles south of the texas capital of austin has a large popular theatre program. this staging calls on strong faculty resources. playing both dukes is michael costello the head of acting instruction at the university a man with a lengthy stage résumé and the stage presence to match it. the melancholy cerebral jacques is artist in residence eugene lee artistic director of the schools annual black and latino playwrights conference who early in his career performed in lorraine hansberrys a raisin in the sun at the lbj ranch for president son. the student cast plays with dedication many of them with eye catching confidence and ability. robert wighs as harsh elder brother  is particularly strong in gesture and diction and his eventual transformation to a simple good guy there deep in the forest is heartening. angeliea stark and keeley koop as runaways  and  are peas from the same pod enthusiastic and effusive. oscar cabrera convincingly shows the gradual maturing of .  the clown as played by nicholas kier was gusty and a bit manic an interpretation of that wise fool emphasizing the fool aspects. i awaited with misgiving his expostulation in act v about the rules of quarreling. kier delivered it at top speed involved all the while in farcical business with ragan rhodes as his fiancée    the dizzily charming fully ripe wench . we paid more attention to his alarm over her lusciousness than to the wit in the lines mocking the court etiquette of quarreling. ashley rountree crafts an apt and vivid cameo as phoebe the shepherdess who falls in love with page ganymede     in the disguise she uses in the forest to join duke seniors band and to instruct  in wooing. rountree gives phoebe a determined swagger and emphatic demeanor contrasting to her feeble wooer  zachary blackwell. shes assertive and yet at the same time appealing. in the dance of general celebration concluding the play ney and choreographers ian saunders and rachel hull ryde include this phoebe aptly in the circle of suitors rather than sending her over to the demoiselles who were wooed. chuck neys as you like it serves both as showcase and as satisfying entertainment. we leave the theatre cheered and refreshed exiting the cool blue of that imaginary birch forest back into the warm texas night.,3,Comedy,Negative
As You Like It,The Restless Ecstasy of As You Like It,Michael Meigs,restless ecstacy the title of the 2010 2011 tour by the american  center players comes from the scottish play 3.2 the scene in which the grim thane uses the phrase to describe his tormented sleeplessness after killing king .  the asc troupe didnt do their  at the university of texas in austin this week but their staging of as you like it corresponded fully to both promises of the tour title.noise music performance and joviality greeted the audience as soon as the house opened.  big round rick blunt beckoned everyone forward with the huge friendliness of a carnival barker as cast members moved freely around the shallow stage at the ut union.  blunt kept up a cheerful patter about the troupe about their dedication to staging in the style of s touring companies about maintaining available light and engaging the audience.  he quickly recruited eight audience members for the seats placed at either side of the stage and one suspects that if there had been room for groundlings he would have enticed students into those roles. austin theatre folk might have been amused to see shannon grounds seated up there stage right for she had played the heroines faithful companion  in beth burns graceful staging here of as you like it at the scottish rite theatre  in 2009.  robert matney the doleful jacques of that production was also in the audience.for the half hour before starting the play cast members strummed guitars tapped rhythms on wooden boxes and a djembe fingered a weathered accordion sang pop songs and carried on like buskers.  it was as if only by chance they had arrived one week late for the restlessness of austins epic south by southwest music festival.   at the interval the cast stayed on stage to play and sing for the full fifteen minutes maintaining an easy companionship with the audience.the ecstasy of their staging of as you like it was that of infatuation the hypnotic attraction of love. the casts one page leaflet explains the set up and the early plotting with bullet points entitled stuff that happens before the play and stuff that happens in the play escorting the audience in simple sentences as far as the arrival in the forest of arden of  and  disguised as men and accompanied by blunt as  the clown.  final bullet teaching loving and learning ensue.  the company of eleven players works before a set of simple archways hung with curtains.  they promise two hours of traffic on this stage and theres not a split second of delay in transitions.  exits and entrances occur with simultaneous swishes through different curtains a precision born of the six months that they have worked together on these stagings.  the rhythm is quick the diction is exact and the stage business is calculated but theres not a hint of staleness.  the audience sees and shares a joy in the disguises the word play and the silly situations.  costuming is indeterminate folksy twentieth century.the central thread of as you like it is the education of the rude although not entirely unlettered  youngest son of the banished duke.  chad bradford plays him as guileless and not terribly bright.  s victory over  the wrestler in a well staged bout appears fortuitous the verses with which he decorates the trees in arden are scrawled upon pink post it™ notes and in the cheerful interplay with the audience some of them wind up affixed to foreheads.  denise burbach as the spunky  is animated and inexplicably enchanted by  and his naive attentions.  one has the impression that shes one smart young woman carried away by her emotions.  disguised as the male page ganymede  entices  to play act to her his infatuation for .  theres no real contest between the two. in this production  doesnt get it until the transformation staged by  and a complicit musician jake mahler representing the god .doubling and tripling of roles is necessary with a traveling troupe of only eleven players.  particularly noteworthy in differentiating his roles is jonathan holtzman who applies a lazily arrogant robert deniro accent to  the wrestler credible backwoods phrasing as  the shepherd and an assured tone of nobility as the banished duke senior. assistant director  henry in contrast plays a single role that of   the shepherd in love with phoebe kelly mckinnon but he does so with such enormous placid incomprehension that he owns some of the funniest moments of the play.and then the fools.  blunt plays the licensed and self certain  with red plastic nose and puppet mace big and bawdy and followed avidly by the audience. he aptly illustrates his set piece disquisition on the seven degrees of a quarrel with clever gesture and directs it toward a male student seated at stage left as his imaginary adversary.  aidan oreilly is the melancholy jacques pronounced jakes preserving s joke reference to the privy or outhouse unperceived by contemporary american audiences.  oreilly has a bit of a rant to his jacques the hauteur of an aristocrat in a white suit flavored with a touch of southern coastal planter drawl.  on the evidence of the following nights performance that subtle accent was authentic and not an affectation even though his bio is all california and europe. jacques short spoken unapologetic and restless departure from the celebrants around the newly restored duke leaves us in the company of the four couples newly betrothed and dedicated to ecstasy.  s epilogue sparks the closing applause and the cast plunges into a rousing version of higher and higher.approving word must have gotten around quickly that evening among students at the university of texas campus in austin for the house was packed the following evening for measure for

As You Like It,RSC Takes a Joyful Romp in Arden,Christopher Adams,walking into the roundhouse theatre in camden i hear the strains of a busker. he is trendy but not too trendy and next to him is a sign that reads its not about the money. classic camden earnestly ironic. while he sings lines from blowin in the wind i glance through my program. trendy busker looks suspiciously like jonjo oneill the actor playing  in the rscs as you like it. it seems the theatre going experience is starting early tonight. as you like it works well as an ensemble piece and features the strongest acting yet from the rsc company. katy stephens is a powerful  and her exploration of what it means to be a woman playing a woman playing a man leads to new insights and fresh encounters with the text. h gale is a talented actress and she makes the most of her role as  even if it is only listlessly playing with a stick while watching  toy with . the   scenes allow two very gifted actresses free range. director michael boyd creates for  an erotic dream as the court members imitate a hunt and play on horn imagery. the dream sequence sets the mood for s sudden love for the reformed   aitken. busking oneill makes for an endearing unrequited lover and forbes massons  does melancholy a good turn. but this is a play with two not one fool like characters. richard katzs  is a clown repressed into dark colors. he wears elongated black shoes and enters in a black straight jacket but his most arresting feature is his wild hair wiry like a clown wig but black and graying. he is both physically comedic and bitter. on the whole the cast conveys a sense of well being and jollity a few times trying to make each other corpse but managing to keep the play together. while the acting is stellar especially from the principals the set is lackluster. tom pipers design is bare and white. the first hint of arden is the tangly bramble engulfing  at his hilarious entrance. as the production moves on the back wall slowly unhinges to reveal hints of forest but has more of an appearance of planks and two by fours. also confusing and unexplained is the costuming choice. the production begins in the dukes court populated with courtiers male dressed in plush black elizabethan garb high fashion of ruffs and drop pearl earrings. the court enters in a kind of shuffle step highlighting later the discussion of country versus court mannerisms underscored to humorous effect when  geoffrey freshwater during the interval bloodily skins and cleans a rabbit and then tells  that kissing hands as a sign of greeting while perhaps appropriate to the court would be less appealing in the country. but as the production moves to the forest of arden we come across the exiled court dressed in russian flavored costumes with swathes of leather hide. the actors carry rifles. as the action progresses  previously costumed in swagger boots and breeches switches to his trendier appearance maybe to match s adventureraviator scarf and loose shirt. toward the end of her career as a man she is sporting converse trainers. in the plays final moments soldiers from the court enter still in black but now in soldier uniforms of the present day carrying machine guns. in this two hour traffic of the stage well three hours we have moved inexplicably some four hundred years. all of the individual parts are well done but the concept does not cohere. a cultural note there is a throw away gag that to my american sensibilities is offensive.  attempting to arrange a marriage between him and  sophie russell calls upon a priest to perform the office. in the production the priest arises out of one of the many trap doors gangly and goofy looking and bearing a cross on fire. did no one explain to boyd that a burning cross is one of the most potent and racially offensive symbols of the last century? unintended i hope offense aside the rscs as you like it is full of joy and contains a well thought out exploration of gender bending in stephenss performance. just dont bother bringing money for the busker.,4,Comedy,Positive
As You Like It,Local and Liking It,Christopher Adams,in an age when to be local is to be connected to the community the rise of locally  sourced food and farmers ets springs to mind local theatre offers an opportunity for homegrown entertainment. the suburban rural community of chesapeake virginia ushers in the summer by making use of local space and local actors with a free outdoor performance of as you like it staged as part of  in the grove.  in the grove is an outgrowth of tidewater community colleges theatre department having performed a an play in the grove a parking lot followed by a flat expanse of thick grass bounded by some trees for the past fourteen years. wooden placards nailed to the two poles that hold the lights detail a production history rich in the comedies except for last years  and 2006s  and . indeed as you like it was performed during the groves first season in 1997. friends couples families young and old turn out with lawn chairs blankets food baskets and a necessity for virginia in the summertime copious amounts of bug spray. the insects prove more problematic than simple bites as the actors have difficulty at times being heard over the rising noise of the cicadas. director edwin jacob chooses a 1960s era treatment for the text. while not fully developed it allows for some humorous moments and the inclusion of joni mitchells both sides now sung by larry von nostrand who provides live guitar music throughout the show. the setting is most effective once the action moves to the forest of arden where duke senior charlie conover in a chill and mellow performance and his followers are cast as nature loving hippies. their first appearance involves a song complete with guitar flute tambourine and the suggestion that some of the forests delights may not be entirely legal. the subsequent discussion about the killing of a deer becomes an advertisement for the benefits of vegetarianism. matthew gorris set is made up of wooden panels atop a raised stage the panels painted in blues and browns to give a generic feeling of a forest. several doors provide for the numerous entrances and exits undersg the plays famous speech all the worlds a stage and all the men and women merely players they have their exits and their entrances  acting is uneven at times with either too much gesticulation or too strong an emphasis placed on the verse meter.  parker as  and bijan samareh as  play up the dopiness of love at first sight with  like an eager boy scout and  more head in the clouds. russ staggs and amber wood deliver smart turns as  and the melancholic jacques respectively. staggs carries around a squeaky bicycle horn which he uses during the punch lines of jokes most of which he manages to make sense of no easy task for s clown characters. it also helps that staggs is not afraid to underline some of s more sexual humor. the true delight of the show is amber wood as the dour deeply embittered jacques. sarcastic and sour she brings definition to her character while imbuing her lines with clarity and insight. then of course there is the other actor in this comedy the weather. the temperature alone was 100 degrees fahrenheit not to mention the intense humidity. by eight oclock in the evening when the production began the temperature had cooled slightly but the mugginess still created a feeling of being trapped inside a tennessee s play. that the actors manage to demonstrate considerable physicality it is a shock to see lanky  samareh take down  ian geers  who is twice his size in one fell swoop is a testament to the productions high energy despite the adverse weather conditions. costumes help ease some of the burden as most of meg murrays designs are loose fitting with unbuttoned shirts flowing fabrics and a general hippie aesthetic nodding to the 1960s era setting though  the wrestlers brian wrestler feather boa lined cape strikes a humorous note with the audience. at a crisp two hours the production is not particularly challenging and character relationships are not explored in depth but  in the grove does manage to make for an entertaining evening finding a mellow bit of good nature in as you like it. ,3,Comedy,Negative
As You Like It,A Forest of Arden Grows in Brooklyn,Roseanne Wells,the bridge project a seasonal company of british and american actors was an international smash last year and 2010 looks to be just as stellar. their current production of as you like it precedes the tempest opening mid february at the brooklyn academy of music both closing on march 13. sam mendes pairs keen directing with a sense of wonder and humor and theatrical stars from both sides of the atlantic wow. catherine zuber costumes a talented cast adding to never distracting from the action and emotion. set designer tom piper runs a grooved textured wall across the stage with one door in its center narrowing the focus and increasing dramatic tension. shuttered windows are cut into the top of the wall allowing for light designer paul pyants blue morning glow to enter during select scenes. christian camargo is a sinewy  lean cheeked and hungry for a better life. he starts the action with high stakes dressed in rough shoddy boots and workmans clothes he growls and paces. i will no longer endure it he snarls ferociously belying the struggle of a younger sibling to get all he feels he deserves. this tension peaks when his flippant brother provokes him camargo strangling him until he cries uncle. although  played by edward bennett is the antagonist at this point bennett dressed sharply in a fine business suit manages to paint  as a troublesome little snot who needs to be taught a lesson after all. ron cephas jones plays  the wrestler as a refined gentleman trained to be equally comfortable in the ring and at the banquet table. he extends the genial olive branch providing  the opportune moment to get rid of the thorn in his side. bennett adopts a perfectly slick veneer of humility and quivering desperation feigning regret in forcing  to kill . but the wad of bills exchanged between the two heals all wounds. the fight a lithe game of skill and physical prowess lit solely by a swinging single bulb lamp with live drumming that thrums in the tense air has a modern fight club feel packed with immediate punches of danger and primal energy. this society isnt as advanced as it would like to think. from beginning to end camargo is sweet and devoted in his adoration of  played by camargos real life wife  rylance. although he is agile and understands  physically camargo sometimes appears awkward and stiff when speaking about anything but his beloved. for act two and beyond piper removes the rough wall of civilization to reveal a bleak and cruel forest planted deep in a beautifully merciless winter. a doorway with something like a gangplank makes a commanding entrance from back center dividing the upper half of the stage. snow blankets stage right and left while craggy trees bear through the winter. pyants lighting adds to the dreary atmosphere as if there were actually a few streaks of sunlight reflected off real snow. pyant could have easily fixed s problem of bringing moonlight into a room in midsummer. duke senior michael thomas also playing an emotionally twisted duke frederick huddles around a charcoal chimney fire with his makeshift court making his opening lines ring with want and suppressed bitterness. richard hansell as  sings clear and true but the real star of the dukes court and the sing along is jacques stephen dillane. when he joins in dillanes spot on impression of bob dylan has the audience cracking up in appreciation through most of the song. sporting a goatee a light step and heavy melancholy on his mind dillane shines in his spontaneity of verse turning jacquess over  and misquoted lines back into spoken communication. michelle beck and  rylance have giggling slumber party best friend chemistry that makes them bubble without being obnoxious. they are like little girls talking across an ottoman about boys fun and tyrannical politics. bouncing puns back and forth with a delightfully intellectual  thomas sadoski the girls play with language making pancakes and mustard much more interesting than they have a right to be. michelle beck is a fine  determined light hearted and devoted to  with a touch of no nonsense to balance s infatuation.  is given her due moments especially when she and  take center stage with their moony eyes and instant lovesickness bennetts  proves to be quite a moody emo lover.  is strong but duke frederick is right she doesnt captivate like  especially in rylances capable hands. equally flattered in her courtly dark forest green cocktail dress her smart looking banishment outfit and her spring beige suit fedora and converse sneakers rylance shines in any situation. she lets herself be vulnerable to s entire range of emotions anger despair giddiness love the whole gambit. the subtlety between  ganymede and ganymede playing  is reable and she defines them as three wholly different parts. rylances attention to the purple prose of the second half especially s wooing of ganymede makes it sound necessary instead of like chatter even during the wedding when everyone confirms their promises over and over. mendes gives us a carefully crafted play that enchants and mystifies. he tinkers to create micro and macro elements of amazement pyants eerie light scheme for s meeting with duke frederick s unusual and graphic hunting dream the decided shift from winter and death to everything refreshed and new s almost conversion to the country life through song and so many other enjoyable tidbits set against a wondrous story of love transforming. we never question where the twinkling hanging lanterns or coordinated cream outfits come from for the wedding or how jacques de boys knows which glen they are in but the magic of the play is part of the transformation. trees grow sonnets girls are boys that are girls and even the clown gets married. the house lights go up for s epilogue and after rylance suitably charms the audience she returns upstage to her waiting  and slams the door on this fairytale a final gesture to a strong production. ,5,Comedy,Positive
As You Like It,Hollywood Hits and Misses at the Shakespeare Theatre,Caitlin DeMerlis,roll out the red carpet because s as you like it is all glamed up for its run at the  theatre but it doesnt look like this ones going to be winning any oscars. applying a hollywood theme to s comedy director  aitken takes audiences on a journey through hollywoods history while attempting to mirror americas history and tell the bards story at the same time. in the program akiva fox literary associate at the theatre points out that the production is meant to highlight s exile as a way of reinventing herself just as many of the founders of hollywood were immigrants who assimilated into american culture. through this lens of immigration aitken serpentines her production through memorable hollywood settings that helped define americas history. confused yet? just wait. as a refresher as you like it follows  and  through their journey into the forest of arden after being banished from the duchy in france in which they once resided.  disguises herself as a man and names herself ganymede in order to travel more easily and stay hidden and her friend  takes on the alias aliena.  and  are in love but  doesnt know that ganymede is actually  in disguise and thus comedy ensues as the two interact. many other love stories play out during as you like it adding to the complexity and entertainment value of the show. as you like it is already full of disguise and confusion it doesnt need anymore. aitkens journey through hollywood destroys the fluidity of s script by forcing many costume and set changes. despite her claim that as you like it is a language drunk play aitken seems to disregard the text in favor of spectacle. beautiful costumes and intriguing sets the most entertaining part of the production drown the story making it difficult for audience members to follow along. throughout many of the set changes the characters are transported to very different parts of america such as going from a native american scene to the deep south and with these visual migrations come accent changes. try remembering whos who who theyre in love with and who they are fleeing from when their dialect costumes and mannerisms change in each setting. despite the confusion aitkens production is visually impressive and entertaining. with set design by derek mclane and costumes by martin pakledinaz the presentation of this classic is titillating. venturing from a stark black white and gray opening using silent films as inspiration the show journeys through multiple eras and locales from a native american campground to a glamorous bar and even swinging through a jungle complete with hanging branches and vines. the costumes enhance every set sometimes paying homage to great films of times past such as a dress for  straight out of scarlett oharas closet. but because accents and costumes change so often continuity disappears. and the settings dont seem to bare any significance to the action on the stage. with the exception of  and s voyage to arden which aitken describes as similar to the hollywood founders journeys to america the rest of the scenes seem to be chosen at random. michael  lachiusas original score is a unique touch. the music is used during scene changes but also during scenes to highlight specific moments helping make the play feel more like a film. lachiusa certainly helps audiences submerge themselves in the time periods and styles presented. unfortunately between the flurry of an overflowing closet and a warehouse worth of set changes the acting gets buried like an unsuspecting victim during a black friday shopping spree. despite the reputation and talent of many of the actors this production of as you like it presents itself as a nightmare for the actors. how can an actor do any character work when the accent costumes and location change so frequently and seemingly for no reason?  francesca faridany does hold her own in the mutant hollywood setting staying somewhat consistent throughout or at least as consistent as possible considering what shes working against.  played by the dashing  behlmann works well opposite faridany making their moments on stage pleasant though still somewhat confusing. there is a certain playfulness apparent in this production of as you like it yet this playfulness is not enough to compensate for the camouflaged storyline. instead of concentrating on the story and script the audiences focus is drawn to what flashy setting and costume design will be revealed next and thus we are sent on a scavenger hunt through hollywood in search of s true themes and meanings. rounding up our journey through hollywood as you like it concludes with a dance number in an environment that nods at the film 42nd street. a large staircase is wheeled in and glittery gowns are donned. the cast sings and dances celebrating the multiple weddings and happy ending. sparkling from top to bottom this final scene creates a beautiful snapshot of classic hollywood. unfortunately for this production theres not much else behind the glam and glitz.,3,Comedy,Negative
As You Like It,As You Like It Sans Nothing,Denise Battista,have you ever been to a play that just plain worked? every actor fits his character every scene change is seamless every direction taken to the point every point an element of surprise and every scene enchanting. have you ever been to a play where everything is as you like it? this artistic team is extraordinary. david lee cuthbert media and scenic designer creates a technological extravaganza with a backdrop of three floor to ceiling screens that project a living breathing city as well as the changing state of nature running the gamut of autumn to spring. these screens could so easily be distracting from both the actors and the play but the integration is as perfectly natural as when seasons change. the projections seem to spill into the stage which is covered at times with leaves or snow falling from above. the realism makes you believe you can actually experience the scent of spring or autumn or the chill of winter. there are city lights and streaming stock quotes and there are the vibrant colors of spring buds or falling snow. cuthbert also overtakes the stage when he enhances the wwf cage match between  and  by projecting it behind them from exciting angles engulfing the stage in a combustion of larger than life excitement. fight choreographer dave maier packs one hell of a punch giving us ringside seats to the fight of the century and haddon givens kime accompanies this production with exciting inspirational and playful original music and sound design. b. moderns costume design is modern yet imaginative colorful and suitable to the character and seemingly based on the concept of layers that cover up and ultimately reveal the truth. the doubling and tripling of characters that goes on in this production is consistently amazing. never is there a moment of confusion as to who plays whom and never is there a moments thought that say the brilliant james carpenter is better at playing  versus  or  versus . as  carpenter is honorable gracious dignified and wise. as the melancholic lord  carpenter is the dark and discontented outsider who somehow achieves our respect because he chooses to be on the outside. carpenter also somehow erases a decade or so from his age between  and  perhaps because he looks like bram stokers eternal dracula the young version less the top hat and glasses. carpenter offers the most sublime moment in the play as he delivers the famous monologue all the worlds a stage  he begins the speech as  but as the words unfold and his clothing drops to the stage floor carpenter literally transforms into  before our eyes. its as though providence intervenes. anna bullard delivers a strong and vibrant performance with just the right amount of channeled testosterone for her take on ganymede balanced with just the right amount of natural beauty and sharp wit to embrace  and to entice the love struck  played here by blake ellis. a bit of natalie wood can be seen in bullard both in appearance and in her impassioned acting style.  cristi miles is adorable as s cousin  bouncing around the stage and squealing with glee. unless shes wearing the wrong shoes this  brings an air of youthful and playful optimism to the stage. bullard and miles together are the epitome of bff while bullard and ellis are charming and endearing lovers at first sight. comedy runs high and wonderfully low in as you like it. craig er is spot on as both  the meathead wrestler and  the cowboy shepherd who is afflicted by the wiles of the gaudy fashion nightmare  played by jeanette penley. sepideh moafi is spectacular as the simple and vulgar  although its nearly impossible to imagine this beauty to be ill favored or one that no man else will take. moafi also takes the role of  a lord waiting upon the banished duke senior to a whole new level incorporating her virtue as an opera soprano into the banished dukes band of merry musical wanderers. andy murray plays both the banished duke senior and the blackberry connected tough guy banisher duke frederick. while bullard carries her load of high comedy and quick wit steve irish trumps all in his one of a kind portrayal of  the clown. irish is big and bawdy and a master of imitations. in clown nose derby cigarette in one hand highball in another and a penchant for golf irish thrusts forward his high powered libido when he finishes his jokes. his booming voice goes from nixon to clinton to schwarzenegger from irish ruffian to german to showing much chutzpah as a yenta and i do believe he even channeled the wizard of oz. these mind you name but a few of the fantastic characters within the great and powerful irish. he is truly magical. this is one heck of an inaugural production for director rick lombardo. lombardo who was artistic director of the new repertory theatre in the greater boston area before coming to serve as artistic director at san jose rep in 2008 asks his audience a simple question ever consider leaving it all behind? in as you like it  draws a distinct line between life at court and living life in the natural world of the forest arden. lombardos line is not so pronounced rather its realistic and invites the audience to learn from and embrace the positives in each realm. youll find its quite easy to leave it all behind for this show. youll also find that when you do get back to it this production gives you something quite splendid to take with you. ,5,Comedy,Positive

As You Like It,As You Like It? It Certainly Is...,Claudine Nightingale, the globe season continues with a traditional production of the ever popular pastoral comedy as you like it. thea sharrocks bright and breezy direction of this wonderfully humorous and powerfully feminist work is both refreshing and uplifting. in the seductive grounds of the globe theatre with their typically suitable costume choices this production gives a straightforward and sincere portrayal of the concept of love. this show is filled with fantastically strong performances both individually and from the company as a whole. although she takes a bit of time to emerge from her shell naomi frederick as the feisty  is an absolute delight. as her determination and confidence emerge frederick flourishes into a character of fantastic depth. disguised as the fresh faced ganymede she presents an intricate combination of manly confidence feminine insecurity and swooning adoration. her costume is entirely convincing and encapsulates an enigma she appears as a passionate emotionally powerful female to  and the audience yet when required frederick is able to quell her nature and then supersede it with the masculine assurance with which she confronts her lover . until the very end where unusually the epilogue is delivered after the traditional jig frederick maintains this endearing and captivating entirely three dimensional character. jack laskeys  is lively and lusty. his boyish good looks and wayward brunette locks make him a believable enticement for the strong minded . laskey offers a young man full of innocent bravery and joviality. although slender and even a little scrawny in comon to the fearless and imposing  the wrestler sean kearns his victory is believable because of his youthful exuberance. there is something of david tennant in laskeys stage presence which has the same appeal as in the man himself although it is so uncanny at some points one wonders if it is a conscious nod to tennant. from his first encounter with  its apparent that there is a truly tangible connection between frederick and laskey. it is a wonderful moment fueled by anticipation that carries them through to the end of the play. another strong relationship within this show is that of  and  laura rogers. the key aspects that bind this play together so successfully are the utterly believable relationships held between key characters. rogers presents  in the perfect light although not the most complex of characters by any stretch rogers gives her as much complexity as is possible creating a faithful and innocent friend for  as she goes about her games of love with . by far the most popular performance with audience members and deservedly so is that of  exquisitely delivered by dominic rowan. as is the feeling with much of this production rowans performance feels incredibly new and modern yet there are no strange outlandish gimmicks to grapple. from the very moment he enters the stage in full jesters costume the audience warms to rowan. before he has even spoken a word ripples of laughter spread throughout the globe. with every line rowan establishes a surprisingly strong connection with the audience as if all his jokes are handpicked to make us happy. his delivery of the lines supported by his endearing physical comedy allows the humor to shine through every pore. there is nothing angry or frightening about this  he is every bit the delightful and desirable companion that we all wish for in our lives. yet another commanding performance is tim mcmullans marvelously melancholic . the audience seems to hang on his every word. mcmullens timing is spot and creates a deliciously moody yet emotionally complex character. he makes the ever famous all the worlds a stage speech feel as fresh as the day young will penned it. credit must also be given to   gale who performs the plays well known songs beautifully. the musicians as a whole should be highly commended. i must confess a note of dubiousness upon noticing in the program that the music is played on modern brass saxophones and clarinets however stephen warbecks composition and execution directed by rob millett is entirely appropriate to the production. by the time of the concluding jig i was literally swept away with the energy and rousing quality of the music. it is by far the most exhilarating and electric performance of a concluding gig i have seen anywhere before. it literally explodes with joy and energy while the carefree and informal modern dancing of all the cast somehow works exceptionally well. this splendid ending topped off with a flawless and uplifting delivery of the epilogue by  concludes a performance that can only be described as an absolute delight. ,5,Comedy,Positive
As You Like It,"As You, Like...You Know Like...Like It",Michael Kostroff,what happens when you take the cadre of wacky characters from s as you like it out of the forest plop them onto venice beach in 2009 and morph them into their modern day la counterparts? youre about to find out perhaps youll even have a bit of déjà vu so goes director jeff morris program note explaining the concept behind declan s theatres current production. its an ambitious concept but why not? ive seen taming of the shrew set in the old west timon of athens in 1920s black and white and a turn of the century much ado about nothing all brilliant satisfying productions. but how would a play with dukes and banishment and fools and such translate into a modern day los angeles setting? well a bit clunkily as it turns out but with some success along the way. ultimately it all depends on whether this kind of  is as you you know like it. i nearly missed the performance as i twice drove right past the sketchy bi level strip mall that houses the next stage theatre. sharing the property with a liquor store launderland the offices of la x press a seamy adult entertainment rag and a key copying kiosk the next stage is so petite that the lighting booth is also the ticket booth. still it has a warmth about it. once inside playgoers find seating on wrought iron benches with surprisingly comfortable cushioning. the black box theatre and set by cast member frank astran show all the signs of a shoestring budget. the upstage wall is covered in yellow felt with a door of black shutters. on either side of the stage is a series of three vertically adjoined pop art paintings of la. between scenes the paintings flip to create the next setting. cubes serve as everything else. here in la where a two oclock appointment means the person youre meeting might show up around two forty five if they show up at all close enough is considered good enough. and the style of this presentation is la through and through casual loose and not too hung up on tradition. first of all sticklers for text and scansion stay home. this is  performed like tv in a thrown away style and phrased however is easiest. at times the performers even make it their own as tv actors are wont to do by adding phrases like yknow hey yeah and even whatchamacallit. me? thats where i draw the line.  should never be paraphrased. then morris choice to change the genders of several of the roles led this company to also change some of the gender specific words throwing off s rhythms. so dont bother counting the beats. theyre not always there. but a  instructor of mine once said if people leave the theatre thinking wow  sure is complicated you havent done your job. and by that measure the cast scores an a. these performers for all their unorthodoxies make good sense of the text and easily bring the audience along through the story. for the most part their intensions are clear and there is certainly a sense of fun about the whole thing. several performances land with particular success. frank astran as  and  gives not one but two great committed and very different performances getting well deserved laughs for his utterly smitten ecstatically tortured . the equally versatile eliza kiss is terrifically honest and subtle in her sensible blue collar take on . and her ditzy bikini clad  along with jake browns really funny surf dude  and lourdes uribes charmingly spacey new age  are highlights. but the real stars of this production are our two leading ladies jenny ashman  and lovelle liquigan  who within the aforementioned style bring such energetic fun and clarity to their roles that one could almost sign off on the productions sometimes reckless approach to the language. almost. ashmans portrayal possesses a quality thats hard to fake but a  requirement immense likeability. and she achieves it with no apparent effort. this is a  wed want to hang out with over margaritas. and shes funny. ashman makes the clever comedic choice that  isnt necessarily all that smooth a liar. so disguised as ganymede shes charmingly unsure as she treads water trying to answer s verbal parries. think of jennifer aniston doing  and youre on the right track. lovelle liquigans brilliantly goofy performance as  is nothing short of a treat. shes a latter day lily tomlin on caffeine. whether taking pictures of herself with her cell phone whining of her weariness while riding on s back or manically sorting through her credit cards in an attempt to buy food from the shepherds shes a natural truthful comic actor who along with partner in crime ashman lifts the whole production several notches higher. the rest of the cast is generally enjoyable interesting and entertaining and there are plenty of good individual moments to go around. what there isnt is much in the way of justification for setting the play in la nor the realization of that choice. yes there are cell phones modern costumes and one or two l.a. stereotypes but nothing quite achieves the promise of morris mission statement. most of the characters are as vaguely defined as the location. the set its two murals notwithstanding is more limbo than la and even had the production succeeded in putting us there ultimately the concept seems forced. this problem is perhaps best exemplified by the moment when  gesturing to a painting on which clearly written are the words venice beach says dryly well this is the forest of arden. there are other poorly thought out directorial choices the confusing addition of a clunky opening sequence of mimed encounters the inserted scene in which a hoodie clad gang attacks  and  one of several awkwardly executed fight sequences. scene breaks are abrupt and badly in need of music. still this is la where half baked concepts often thrive. while this approach isnt this reviewers cup of herbal tea the show did hold my interest. and for the performances alone you may find it well worth a look.,3,Comedy,Negative
As You Like It,A Vivid Reflection on As You Like It,Melissa Crismon,originally composed computer music costumes that evoke visual artists and iconic characters set on a romantic but not ornate stage all refer to the distant and recent past. there is not a particular time period on which to fixate here. though director tom dugdale keeps the importance on the written word and acting in uc san diegos production of as you like it he takes artistic liberties that create the unexpected. enter a melancholy and frivolous modern world.dugdale a candidate for a master of fine arts in directing begins as you like it with what appears to be an added scene. the production doesnt begin with act one scene one. instead the flip flopped scenes one and two come after dugdales initial ditty. the play opens with  maren bush who walks onstage and lies down on a bed. enter  patrick riley through the tall red double doors.  gets up to play music on the victrola with original music by jason ponce. the audience isnt privy to who these characters are since the play does not begin as written and the characters say nothing to each other. when  picks up the victrola that  cranks there is a sense that he is going to smash the phonograph. bodies tense with the expectation and then the unexpected happens.  sets the phonograph on a chair and the tension releases but then you ask yourself is this as you like it? the play continues with the granted flip flopping but its the opening scene that emphasizes the importance of  and  the melancholic and the innocent and the past and present.while the love between  and  is one of the main stories dugdales direction balances all the giddy love affairs with the satirical commentary of . there is clarity as to why  character is necessary when riley whose messy hair and painted white face is intriguingly reminiscent of the joker in the dark night delivers the famous lines all the worlds a stage and all the men and women merely players they have their exits and their entrances  while reflecting into a clever pond in the forest of arden.  analyzes all the other characters while reflecting upon himself.the actors are not merely players on this stage. there is particular care of phrasing. it is easy to forget a story is being told in poetic verse in dugdales fast paced production. evan powell who plays  is a seasoned  actor who executes his character with passion. s love interest  played by maren bush is as giddy as a school girl and then smoothly changes sex when she and her cousin  become runaways in the forest of arden. in her disguise as ganymede bush is coy in terms of love and bully as a boy placing her hands flat on her hips as if to give the appearance that her curves are straight. she then rolls back and forth on her heals to move linearly like a man.bush also has a great rapport with lorene chesley . in flirty skirts chesley commands the stage with her rich speaking voice and graceful dancers body. in the forest of arden  too falls in love but with  josh wade the brother of .  maritxell carrero falls in love with the comedic  ny gill who excites the audience. and  zachary harrison ultimately convinces phoebe marshel s to fall in love with him. with all this love we remember the only odd man out and reflect back upon  melancholic companionship gazing back at him in the serene and solitary pond.the whimsical costume design by sohhee han is a reflection of the forest of arden. the costumes are a fantastic combination of multicultural themes and a range of eras with knickers petticoats and suits to enhance the direction of the intermingling of planes persons tenses along with the past present and future. in the forest of arden when the dwellers enter with a parasol in hand the stage painted with a birdcage and petticoats the scene calls forth a colorful renoir. one of the more vibrant costumes is s red top long skirt with a petticoat underneath and a striped apron. s costume and braids suggest frida kahlo except without the uni brow.the stage design is less elaborate in appearance than the costume design. two tall walls each with double doors meet in a corner creating a room that is virtually empty. open books are thrown and piled to make mounds here and there against the walls that remain constant. a bed is rolled in and out to inspire s room while leaves float down signifying the forest of arden. there is a pond of water that is contained underneath the stage and the audience is able to view the stage from above so that one may appreciate the carpentry that went into the portion of the stage cut out for the sake of the pond.dugdale both begins and ends this production with his own bold signature as this appropriate play for university students in a masters program exits with a happy ending instead of ending with s epilogue. in an anxious world this fanciful production is light hearted and yet has plenty of cynicism for those who enjoy a dose of realism. either way reflect on it as you like it.,4,Comedy,Positive
As You Like It,An Adaptation Most 'Honor'-able,Liz Kimberlin,honor is a very ambitious new musical based on  s popular as you like it with the twist that its set in feudal 16th century japan and has an edge so dark that even women the royals carry around ancestral suicide daggers just in case. honor is an uneven work and feels as if it could use another draft or two before its truly finished. but the most important components a strong score and libretto are already pretty much in place. writers  mills and cara reichel are faithful enough to the classic gender bending romance that its recognizably as you like it in fact it even retains bits and pieces of s dialogue but there is enough of a departure from the original story that it can truly stand as a work in its own right.with all the samurai swords swinging nicely staged by fight choreographer jacob grigolia rosenbaum theres certainly more violence death and murder than the bard wrote for as you like it. theres a ritual seppuku suicide in the first five minutes of the show. characters are merged into other characters some who were originally more minor become more prominent duke frederick for instance. the nature of at least one major character changes  and some characters just arent present period. despite its shortcomings this proves a very very enjoyable production and this is due in good part to the fact that mills and reichel have created a tighter more cohesivecoherent story that isnt so bogged down with all the extraneous characters taking up space in the forest of arden erica beck hemmingers scenic design and dax valdes choreography have some haunting instances of being merged into one especially in the forest scenes as the ensemble members bear bamboo branches and act as the spirits of the trees to whom the benign takehiroduke senior sings thanks for their protection. while costume designer sidney shannons floral patterns for the kimonos seem awfully modern for 16th century japan theyre gorgeous nonetheless. there are a couple of awkward moments in the musical numbers but for the most part director cara reichels staging is elegant and inspired.the biggest problems at least in the performance i attended are technical. the volume of the five piece orchestra piano percussion woodwinds violin cello is not well balanced. it comes entirely from one side of the stage and is bumped up to a point that it often overpowers the singers who are not miked. some of the lovely lyrics are completely lost as a result and this might also account for the fact that there are several pitch problems in what are otherwise quite beautiful singing voices. unfortunately the need for stronger voice projection also sometimes extends to general dialogue. despite the fact that i was sitting only a couple of rows from the stage there were times i was really straining to hear what some of the younger lead characters were saying. and having to keep up with japanese characters identities is a lot of work. the names hana  and kiku  are easy enough to remember but the cast program doesnt list the  equivalent along with the japanese names and it can be difficult to keep up with whos who when an offstage character is mentioned in the dialogue.performances range from pretty good to excellent. of the young cast diane veronica phelan hana and vincent rodriguez iii yoshiro make pleasant enough lovers although they seem a bit mismatched. their duet if i were she at the close of act 1 is very touching. jaygee macapugay mitsukuphoebe like phelan and rodriguez has the tendency to mug and grimace during songs but she is charming as the peasant girl who barks up the wrong bamboo shoot by falling for hana disguised as a boy. the real standout though is romney piamonte who is just delightful and very charismatic as kuro the boy trying to win cold mitsukus heart.takehiroduke senior is wonderfully played and sung by veteran broadway actor ming lee who brings a nuanced spirituality to the usurped diamyos role. david shih is terrific as takehiros brother and nemesis katsunoriduke frederick. katsunoris character at present is written as a stock almost cartoonish villain and is even made to look like the glowering bad guy we all associate with toshiro mifune samurai movies. shih overcomes that by giving katsunoris ruthlessness an element of dignity and contemplative restraint. since shih also has a fine singing voice it would have been nice for the two brothers to have a song together and possibly provide further depth to their complicated relationship.  another broadway and film veteran alan ariano does an elegant star turn as the melancholy samurai makoto a darker character with a more haunted past and a more doomed future than his as you like it counterpart. jacques monologues i met a fool i the forest a motley fool and of course all the worlds a stage dont seem to have an equivalent in honor in either text or song which is a bit disappointing. but ariano really shines in the scene where makoto teaches yoshiro haiku which is followed by a captivating song by the next new moon.last but not least steven eng takes home this productions glory prize for his delicious portrayal of nobuyuki the lazy but loyal samurai charged with protecting hana and kiku. a far cry from the traditional fool  nobuyuki proudly espouses the fine art of self preservation through being innocuous. his song little gray stone all about the benefits of cruising beneath the radar and in between ing is honors show stopper and eng performs it with great relish.with a little more work honor probably has the potential to become a very popular show across theatre ets both professional and amateur. as it stands now mills reichel and the company are to be commended for creating such a nice tight highly imaginative but very accessible adaptation of one of s most popular plays and giving it their own signature.,4,Comedy,Positive
As You Like It,"""As You Like It"" Amiable at the Folger",Georgina Petronella,even though as you like it is a comedy it can be one of s harder plays to enjoy. the action clusters in the first and final scenes and nothing much really happens in the middle. the narrative lacks thrust and the result is a potentially tedious evening. the folger theatres production as directed by derek goldman embraces the meandering nature of the play and mostly succeeds in keeping things interesting.the plot such as it is unfolds with a dukes banishment to the forest of arden by his usurping brother. the daughters of the dukes  and  remain at court firm in their friendship for each other. during a sporting tournament  meets  and it is love at first sight. alas s father orders  to follow her father into exile or die.  refuses to be parted from her cousin and the pair hatch an escape plan.  disguises herself as a boy named ganymede and along with  and court fool  they journey to the forest of arden. once in the forest where the bulk of the play takes place the action slows down considerably.  of course finds his way to arden meets the disguised  and is encouraged to woo himher. romance also abounds with the introduction of several other characters.  pursues a country lass named  and  a shepherd courts a disinterested . the various entanglements leisurely fluctuate until quite suddenly the banished duke is allowed home. everyone is sorted out learns something and is married.even if nothing terribly exciting happens onstage at least the set is eye catching. the playful and evocative scenic design by clint ramos is a highlight of the evening. the court consists of a neat arrangement of cubicle appropriate office chairs. two sturdy columns permanent fixtures of the folgers elizabethan stage are lit in black and white squares. the total effect is of a droll greco roman conference room. the arden set is even more fun. the transition from the court into the forest in fact ranks as one of my favorite theater moments in a long time. two humming forest dwellers bring out a series of lime green ladders and artfully place them around the stage to represent trees. lit silhouettes of leaves slowly dot the columns accompanied by a haunting melody. the lights and sound set just the right mood for this resolutely unrealistic yet romantic set.joseph marcell is the standout of the cast. marcell best known as the long suffering butler on tvs the fresh prince of bel air plays  a melancholy yet sociable member of the forest.  is an observer of life rather than a participant and yet he finds joy in his musings. marcell is by turns dry giddy somber and brooding and he handles his ridiculously famous speech all the worlds a stage  with ease and aplomb. i have always viewed  as a loner among lovers but here there are hints that he is in love with . goldman inserts a love ballad sung by  near the end of the play. although the moment is lovely its motivation is unclear. in any case marcell does a marvelous job with the most interesting role of the play.the rest of the cast is good but not outstanding. amanda quaid randys daughter makes her dc debut in the lead role. she postures a little too much as ganymede but employs a big goofy grin to good effect as . miriam silverman as her cousin  and noel vélez as  are both just fine. two wacky country girls  tonya beckman ross and  jjana r garner a lot of laughter without going over the top.  played by local favorite sarah marshall is here played by a woman as a woman. all references to s gender have been switched. this certainly adds a different flavor to the  relationship and their straightforward courting stands in contrast to all the heterosexual antics.i find  a little wearisome on the page and in the flesh marshall is a little too self consciously kooky. there is a fair amount of singing some in the text some added by the director and i particularly enjoyed the warbling of an actor matthew mcgloin billed only as first lord. with his sweet voice and open face he captures the spirit of arden in his expression and i perked up whenever he appeared.pacing and tone issues tarnish the production. the show runs almost three hours and the second half in particular feels too long. we get bogged down by too many forays into song dance and bits of stage business that go nowhere. there is a long acted out speech given by  and the rest of the cast youll know it when you see it whose only purpose seems to be to cover s costume change. another misstep is the court wrestling event staged as a wwf spectacle complete with a large hairy man in a sparkly red cape a booming announcer and a video accompaniment. the whole thing comes out of nowhere and disappears into nowhere setting the tone askew. in the same vein the messily choreographed wedding includes a brassy song by the goddess  kiah victoria and the scene just feels weird. goldmans direction shines more in the smaller moments. to launch the play for example an old man terrence currier hobbles wearily down the steps and into the audience. the moment is powerful precisely because of its intimacy.the costumes by carol bailey are gorgeous across the board. sometimes the dazzle lacks logic though. i have no idea what to make of the three guards in large furry hats on stilts and as ive mentioned the too contemporary wrestler is bizarre. most of the costumes shoot for timelessness with a motley flower child touch sprinkled over arden. the gender bending in this production is profuse as are the many forms of love familial romantic heterosexual homosexual so the hippie clothing mostly works.the director is a former professor of mine and i couldnt help but notice his continuing interest in contrasting two worlds and exploring their transformative capabilities. goldman has tackled the winters tale and eurydice in recent years two other plays that also explore the differences between two worlds sicilia and bohemia the world of the living and the dead and how such a journey can alter a person. as you like it plays once more on this theme. everyone learns something in the idle forest of arden and changes whether they like it or not.,4,Comedy,Positive
All's Well That Ends Well,As You Like It a Matter of Taste,Tanya Gough,kenneth branaghs as you like it set in meiji era japan is a strange mishmash of a film. from the beginning the director prepares us for inconsistencies with a haiku that tell us he has envisioned a dream of japan and yet the film is lacking the sense of heightened reality one would normally associate with a dream. instead we are given a vastly misguided attempt to approximate a culture that the filmmakers apparently did not research in any great depth. the end result is a series of stereotypes and gross errors that sadly diminish the japanese and their culture. while i do understand mr. branaghs desire to situate his characters in a place that is both foreign and potentially mysterious i am at a loss to explain the fundamental choices he made regarding the plot and various elements of japanese culture. the film opens with duke frederick storming duke seniors home while the latter is idyllically enjoying a dance performance in his court. that brian blessed plays both dukes frederick in black and senior in white is an interesting concept but unfortunately the blackwhite dichotomy has the unfortunate effect of stereotyping which is never explained nor justified. it also suggests that there is something fundamentally nasty about japanese samurai culture on one hand while the ninja are so laughably sloppy and flatfooted they make a mockery of martial arts. there are many other ways that branagh misrepresents japan all contributing to the sense that the filmmakers were just making things up as they went along. among the most glaring mistakes includes the japanese peasant who finds  bryce dallas howard and  romola garai in the forest. he backs away and gestures to them to follow with hand movements that are clearly western the japanese gesture for come here has the palm facing down not up. other inconsistencies incorporate scenes of the refugees doing tai chi on the hillside tai chi is chinese not japanese and finally phoebe jade jeffries is dressed to look like a japanese peasant but behaves like a spoiled valley girl. of course the fact that the plot requires a wild lioness to jump out and attack  doesnt help matters since lions are hardly native to japan but even if one can suspend disbelief enough to accept branaghs premise that the entire film is a dream the film remains riddled with so many inconsistencies they appear to be caused by ignorance rather than design. what does hold the film together are energetic and charming performances by bryce dallas howard as  and a virile unpredictable and suitably over earnest david oweleyo as . while both actors overplay their parts in a way that sacrifices depth of character they speak their lines beautifully and with a certain forthrightness that newcomers to  will appreciate. romolo garais  is deeply touching in some of the earlier scenes but she sadly descends into slapsticky physical comedy once she and  reach arden and then only serves as comic relief. alfred molina does nicely as  playing him as an understated version of the victorian fop stock character. indeed most of the characters in this film are also overplayed as though comedy requires superficial style rather than depth. one notable exception is adrian lester who nearly burns off the screen as s hostile older brother  and it is deeply ironic that he is the only actor on the screen who seems to have mastered the japanese trait of appearing intensely powerful but also very still. particularly disappointing is kevin kline as jacques. kline mumbles and shuffles his way across the screen until one wonders why he even bothered to show up. he acts as neither counterpoint for the comedy nor philosophical commentator since he is too disengaged to even seem relevant. it is a shame that such a fine cast has been wasted on what finally amounts to a superficial and sloppy artistic vision especially when branagh is so well known for his attention to detail in other  films such as henry v much ado about nothing and . in the end as you like it is an unfocused misguided and meandering mess. a shame really because at its heart lies a core group of actors who bring a lot of joy and freshness to the table.,2,Comedy,Negative
Hamlet,An Involving Hamlet on Summer Eve,Glenda Pearce,with   intended to entirely involve his audience and right from the outset the characters come to chat with us on this warm summer evening as if wed come to court to attend the wedding celebrations of queen  steph curtis and king  jonathan gabriel.  jordan henare says pointedly that you cant catch the plague covid if youre arrogant and obnoxious which he says he is. a quick announcement lets us know that the show must go on and due to illness the part of  will be readplayed by matthew diesch tonight. he reads the part with a total understanding of the bumbling verbose and paradoxical figure that  is. the well known advice and witticisms are delivered with clarity and an underplayed matter of factness which works well as well as a fine sense of the character. diesch bring nice touches of humour throughout his rendition of this above all to thine own self be true and it must follow as the night the day thou canst not then be false to any man delivering timeless fatherly advice while  jordan henare has his bag packing checked or such as the elbow covid greetings between  aidan leddy and  zane wood. it is always refreshing to see how a director takes a classic play you know well and gives it new angles and perspectives whilst remaining true to the plays original intent. excellent direction and creative vision by james bell who uses the potential of the outdoor multi level set design james bell aria harrison sparke and jason moffatt and brings to life a powerful revenge story full of betrayal and deceit interspersed with comic humour and s understanding of humanity. exits entrances and use of the audience space are expertly managed. costume design aria harrison sparke lighting and sound design siobhan donnelly are all superb. with rich resonant tones ben plummer plays the ghost of king s remember me with angry powerful intensity. his appearance to his already melancholy and angry son convincingly provides the motivation for  to take action against his uncle in retribution for murdering his father and marrying his mother. a convincing and charming queen  steph curtis suffers reliance on men trying to balance the needs of motherhood with a much loved son going mad and its effect on the innocent  and maintaining her new role as wife not to mention keeping strong as den is invaded by norway.  king  jonathan gabriel is suitably skilful as the corrupt politician whose main weapon is his ability to manipulate others conceit in weakest bodies strongest works. what is distinctly new is the pirate costuming and commedia dellarte style of  and  meg s and  wilson. initially as drunken louts they bring a lively comic touches as only university friends of  could bring yet were easily persuaded these two could betray their friendship to . in what are often seen as inconsequential characters these two are entirely engaging while as  exposes their plot do you think i am easier to be playd on that a pipe? aidan leddy is truthful as  s loyal friend and confidant.  warns  several times notably about the execution order  and  should deliver as well as warning him against fighting . faithful to the last  realizes this in the final touching moments when he entrusts  with the faithful telling of this whole tragedy were witness to. the character s speeches are testament to s genius a demanding and multi faceted role that is well done by wood. a young university student with deep intellectual emotional and philosophical insight expressed in musings such as what a piece of work is man how noble in reason  are captured in woods performance with ownership and clarity. yet theres more in what he doesnt say possibly more even he isnt aware of. in contrast to wood some of the other cast members lost the emotional connection with the audience when delivering their lines thereby losing their power. poor . from her very first scene men are always telling her what to do. aria harrison sparke superby handles the court scene where  is on the edge. her touching relationship with her brother  jordan henare establishes what might be the only unconditional love she knows. lovely touches and wet edges on her costume foreshadow her drowning fate. her tragedy lies in the way she loses her innocence through no fault of her own. the success of any play ultimately lies in the contributions of all the cast. every cast member is believable focused and contributes to the overall success of the production some of which sophie watson stephen ellis bess brookes gabrielle reid playing several roles in the same manner  s company would have. involved in this production from the outset youll feel the same. the 25th summer 2021  in the park much ado and  runs january 23   february 20. tickets on eventfinda.co.nz or 09 489 8360. children under 15 free.,4,Tragedy,Positive
Hamlet,The Tragedians of the City Waterfront,Jennifer Kramer,given that  famously features a major plot pivot supplied by a band of roving actors and their emended play it seems eminently appropriate to have a production of  literally comprising a band of roving actors and their emended play. led by director dan hodge and hosted by philadelphias independence seaport museum this group of local actors presents a fast paced and stripped down production of  that explores the plays core concepts. the production is staged in the independence seaport museums rotunda a glassed in space providing all of penns landing and the scenic philadelphia waterfront as a backdrop to the minimalist set dressing. the intimate performance area mimics a thrust stage ed only by painters tape and the bounds of the audiences chairs a pair of maroon drapes hang from the second story balcony suggesting royal grandeur as well as providing plot critical arrases. the only other semi permanent structures are an antique wooden chair with a red velvet cushion switching out duties as a throne regular seat and interrogation aid and  ever present drink cart. the costuming is modern dress and business formal abounding in three piece suits and dresses with blazers   with a few notable exceptions like  and his inky hoodie. as the play progresses order breaks down  loses her floral blazer trying to staunch  wounds  strips down to his shirtsleeves as he soliloquizes about his guilt and drinks straight from the bottle  trades her preppy plaid trousers and concealing argyle sweater for a night shirt bare legs and seeping blood from an apparent miscarriage.  meanwhile signals his acceptance of his fathers legacy by turning up in act v scene 1 outdressing everyone having finally put on a full suit a somber black one best fit for funerals. the relatively small cast of nine adeptly handles the outsize play delivering uniformly strong performances. brian mccann  stephanie hodge  and charlotte northeast  have excellent familial chemistry. a soft spoken but sharp hodge and a brash northeast quickly establish a deep sisterly affection equally mixing concern and good humored mockery. mccann meanwhile gives  an unnerving controlling streak that goes largely unheeded by his daughters northeast and hodge in particular show their characters gravitating towards  warmth and confidence even as he attempts to dictate every facet of their lives. the cast also makes use of more subtle moments for great impact. steve wright imbues  with a reserve and dignity carefully maintained throughout the plays reversals which makes the reveal that he is seconds away from downing poison even more heartbreaking. dan hodge in addition to solid performances as the ghost and the gravedigger portrays the shows first and only player as shy and skittish his transformation during his soliloquy on the death of priam is a pleasant reminder that actually actors are quite good at acting   as well as a thematic callback to s need to transform himself into someone who can avenge his father. robert daponte gives a fine performance as the titular prince of den balancing emotional anguish with wry humor and frustrated energy. daponte plays  as constantly striving for human connection just beyond his grasp desperately pulling the reserved  into a hug chafing at s withdrawal blooming under rosencrafts attention before realizing its ulterior motives and reaching for but never touching his fathers ghost. at the same time daponte also emphasizes s latent potential for violence in the way he yanks around  christie parker or threatens to drop rosencraft annette kaplafka on her head a preview of his murderous fits. one of the most reable aspects of this production of s longest play is its hour and forty minute run time as director dan hodge et al. have slightly modernized and significantly edited the text. however only two scenes appear fully cut iv.2 and iv.4 and most of the plays major plotlines   and its famous speeches   are represented. the focus is now solely on the interpersonal conflict within den with nearly all references to local and international politics trimmed away and the production relies heavily on the actors performances to augment lines and soliloquies pared down to their core. for the most part the production follows up on the ripple effect of these edits to good effect for example  no longer states outright that he will put on an antic disposition so his numerous jests are narrowed down to a pointed few and daponte is able to keep the true extremity of s emotional turmoil intriguingly ambiguous. a further transformation is accomplished by drawing out subtextual interpretations. annette kaplafka plays rosencraft a composite of rosencratz and  who expands on the duos double entendres and sexual banter to act as s old flame willing to renew their relationship at the monarchs behest. meanwhile accompanying s madness with evidence of a miscarriage spells out the extent of her broken off relationship with  while adding physical trauma to the many emotional stressors responsible for her madness. the interplay of these two womens relationships with  has the potential to add an interesting dimension to the production. unfortunately the trimming of act v comes off as rushed rather than streamlined and the conclusion of these arcs falls by the wayside. casually dismissing rosencrafts fate is not an unusual interpretation but at s graveside  almost immediately launches into a fistfight with  skipping his actual lamentation of her death. this is part of the larger issue that  somehow gains the drive and determination to avenge his father and vanquishes his tendency to overthink his plans completely offstage since how all occasions do inform against me was cut and nothing seems to replace it. the careful ambiguity of how in control of his actions he is instead is now replaced with a single minded competence that deflates some of the tension and leaves the audience with the rather unique problem of not really knowing what  is feeling. however this does not negate the quality of the rest of the play. the tight editing gives the first four acts a thrilling pace enhanced by the minimalist setting and christopher waters sparing but effective live music. almost every aspect of the production contributes to the central theme of emotional tension spiralling out of control and hodges direction and the casts performances are supremely confident. the overall effect feels like visiting a pop up bar or listening to a virtuoso musician busking in the subway a performance that is not so much spontaneous as fortuitous where a wealth of creativity and talent finds a favorable circumstance and draws together to produce a unique experience.  at the seaport museum is a great showcase of both passion and craft a thoughtful take on a classic that shows just how effective a roving band of actors can be.,4,Tragedy,Positive
Hamlet,Who Needs Dragons with Classics Like Hamlet?,Benjamin Alper,sex murder adultery madness political assassination sword fighting no this isnt the premiere of game of thrones its  at the  tavern playhouse who needs dragons when lee osorio in the title role breathes fires as he turns s words into scalding hot passion? putting on s most famous play is no easy feat but the atlanta  companys current production does a credit to the author. as the most famous play in the world  presents many daunting challenges for any company attempting to stage it. the plays notoriety means that any audience is going to have exceedingly high expectations walking into the theater. also so many of the plays most powerful lines and moving speeches have become so ingrained in our culture and vocabulary that it can be difficult for an audience to disassociate these lines from their modern usage to keep them within the context of the play. when such lines as to be or not to be  the lady doth protest too much and alas poor yorick have been parodied repurposed and misquoted so many times it can be hard for the actors to convey their true power and import. thankfully the atlanta  company has several phenomenal actors who through their passion and physicality breath new life into s great words. osorio who most recently stole the show with his portrayal as richard in richard ii steals it once again here. as  one of the most demanding roles an actor can take on osorio delivers an incredible performance and his supporting cast was equally impressive. chris kayser plays the pompous and obtuse  to perfection. in a play filled with so much death madness and devastation kaysers appearance on stage was a welcome respite from an otherwise dark and intensely emotional play. the chemistry between shelli delgado  and bridget mccarthy  was also quite moving. with their bond as brother and sister convincingly established at the beginning of the play  pain and sorrow as  descends into madness is truly devastating to watch. it was also a delightful treat to see the ascs artistic director jeff watkins deliver a wonderful performance as . watkins portrayal of the foppish yet cruel usurper was convincing to the point of being off putting as the characters cruelty and cowardice competed with each other to make  utterly loathsome to the audience. as s longest play  also presents serious challenges for its director who must invariably choose which parts of the play to cut and which are essential. this is no doubt an intimidating task who wouldnt feel presumptuous editing ? but director jaclyn hofmann rises to the occasion and makes excellent choices with this production in order for it not to feel rushed and also not drag. at a run time of approximately three hours hofmann was able to fully harness the texts power without turning what is already an emotionally exhausting play into a physically demanding one for the audience not to mention the actors. the  tavern playhouse is the ideal setting for a staging of . with its many soliloquies and its focus on deeply personal self reflection  is best performed in the close and intimate setting that the tavern provides. rather than being far removed from the audience the actors get to deliver their soliloquies surrounded by and up close to the audience which serves to heighten the emotional stakes of this play. the added effects of smoke and lighting helped to enhance the tension of each scene without being overly distracting. given its phenomenal acting great direction and intimate theater setting the atlanta  companys production of  makes for an unforgettable night at the theater. while game of thrones with its dragons and special effects may be the cultural  of the last decade this production reminds us why  has been a cultural  for the last four hundred years. correction the actress playing  was incorrect. it has been corrected to shelli delgado.,5,Tragedy,Positive
Hamlet,CSF’s Female Hamlet Provides Universal Perspective,Ginny Quaney,over the course of its sixty seasons the colorado  festival established in 1958 has produced s most famous play eight times. this averages to a  per decade spanned except for the 1980s in 1988 csf double dipped to capitalize on the then popularity of top gun star val kilmer who was cast as the eponymous dane. unsurprisingly ticket sales soared and the festival earned the denver drama critics circles best season for a company prize. this years  number eight may give the 1988 production a literal run for its money   as of a few days before opening night non balcony tickets in the indoor university theatre werent available until august. thats what happens when you celebrate your sixtieth year with an actress lenne klingaman playing . as a woman. while the dramaturgs program notes elucidate that more than 200 women have taken on the role of  in the last 300 years which sounds like a lot until you realize that tens or perhaps hundreds of thousands of productions have been performed in that time it wasnt until the twentieth century that actresses began to play  as female. many of s qualities would have appeared feminine to an elizabethan audience including his penchant for melancholy and weeping and his erratic behavior the notes say. fortunately klingaman and director carolyn howarth do not fall into that trap this  rarely cries and when she does most notably in the rogue and peasant slave soliloquy she seems to berate herself for it. many a male  has shed far more angsty tears than this one. from the start snow falls on a gray and desolate set with pillar like trees or tree like pillars and logs that double as tables or chairs or headstones whichever the scene requires. this is not a castle or wooded glen to be caught alone in. setting aside the inherent creepiness and the literal and symbolic climate of rottenness and death the bleak isolation proves s declaration that dens a prison a despairing truth rather than depressive hyperbole. in s initial entrance she rushes onstage leaving a loud and apparently enthusiastic party and sits head in hand. she is dressed in a lovely gown which at first looks black but is revealed when the lights fully come up to be a deep purple   perfect for a character who is a grieving child first and a royal second. when she hears people coming she gathers herself to lurk moodily in the background of the scene. before words are even spoken we know that she is upset but attempting to hide the extent. what makes this  different from other productions with female leads is that howarth made a specific choice to cast not only  but also  and  as women the formerly father son relationships   now all father daughter as dramaturg hadley kamminga peck writes. and so  becomes one of several women with controlling father figures. these changes provide a unique twist on nearly all the relationships.  ava kostia becomes a doting and wise older sister rather than an overprotective older brother her advice to  about  seems to be a warning based on romantic experience rather than an attempt to keep those crazy feminine emotions in check. in fact  and s emelie ohara giggly teasing first scene with each other is adorable making their eventual fates that much more tragic. they gang up on their father  rodney lizcano wonderfully unrecognizable several scenes later as the gravedigger by repeating his own advice as he recites it including the famous to thine own self be true its clear theyve heard this same lecture before and would rather not sit through it again. its unclear how close  and her mother are supposed to have been prior to her fathers death but her betrayal and disgust toward  mare trevathan implies that she disapproves for different reasons than the classic patriarchal and oedipal ones. in fact s gary wright order disguised as request for  not to return to wittenberg and his hug after  begrudgingly agrees carry a creepy sexual undertone that is absent from traditional portrayals. while  may just dislike her uncle for obvious reasons there are hints that fratricide and his incestuous marriage may not be his only crimes. s friends are all male but their characterizations dont change because of her gender    and  michael bouchard and sean scrutchins are the same witless users as always although they stand out from the background into which the pair sometimes fades likely due to the fact that csf is producing tom stoppards  and  are dead later this season with the same cast. in their first scene one of them which one is which again? enters flipping a coin a clear reference to stoppard. jihad milhems  too remains the same loyal platonic friend he usually is but here hes allowed a little more depth. he enters and exits with the mad  her keeper for a time. he even sweetly sings along with her as he takes her flowers and leads her offstage. this interpretation gives  something to do in s absence and creates a weightiness for a character whose main personality trait is exposition guy. though one wonders where he is when  drowns   picking up  from the docks perhaps? but the highlight of the show comes in the get thee to a nunnery scene.  and  are still lovers except both of them happen to be women. this is never treated as odd s objections seem to be aimed more at s personality and station than her or his daughters sexual orientation. once again howarth avoids the low hanging fruit. klingaman and ohara are fantastic together. the raw yet complex emotions are written clearly on each womans face   there are no manly emotional masks hiding true feelings here.  is a reluctantly obedient daughter still smitten by her love  is angry and hurt and betrayed and confused in turns. klingamans get thee to a nunnery is at first a warning to get away from the rottenness of elsinore and s own absorbing revenge plot after  returns her letters and gifts the line becomes an anguished retort intended to cause pain. but the line becomes a worried warning when she realizes  is being used by her father to spy on him. oharas confusion throughout is wonderful as she becomes frightened that the woman she loves is losing her sanity and pushing her away. at the emotional climax  ends up comforting a spiraling  holding and kissing her until she calms in spite of all that came before. once  gathers herself the final to a nunnery is clearly an attempt to save    please leave this horrible prison of a place and save yourself. the audience is left feeling vaguely voyeuristic and  and  seem to have completely missed the point of what they just overheard. all the pronouns for the female characters have been changed to sheher all the lords to ladys and so forth. despite the apparent threat to s scansion no rhythms sound glaringly off although some puns such as s i am too much i the sun lose their double meaning. but while several jokes are lost many are created   s declaration that man delights not me elicits a giggle from  and  and her follow up of no nor woman neither comes off as a good natured defense against the type of teasing only old friends who know your romantic history can get away with. thankfully s famous line good night sweet prince is left alone whether due to the lines rhythm its fame or societys sexist baggage a gender change just wouldnt have the same ring to it. surprisingly the impression left after the fall of the curtain is traditional. the performances are all good klingamans  is excellent and avoids the major pitfalls of the role some relationships are given an interesting subtle twist but mostly it feels like   . even the costumes seem to indicate a broad applicability. they arent burdened by anything as plebeian as time   the royals and  look like they stepped out of a jane austen novel the gravedigger and players are somewhat dickensian  who wears an aviatrix hat and goggles in one scene and  would be at home on prince edward island with anne shirley the performing players look like they belong in the original globe theatre and  in his three piece suit could have been plucked off the street outside. and maybe that universality is the point.  is s most famous play for a reason. perhaps it could be set in any time in any place with a male or female lead in an array of platonic familial and romantic relationships and it would still be    a tragic story of murder and power revenge and justice honor and indecision. hopefully over the next sixty years csf will continue to test that theory.,4,Tragedy,Positive
Hamlet,Crossing Gender: The Great Lakes Theater production of Hamlet with Double-Casting,Yuko Kurahashi,the great lakes theater production of  entertains and challenges the audience with the double casting of laura welsh berg and jonathan dyrud both play  on their off days in the title role offering different interpretations of one of the most complex characters in s work. i attended both performances with welsh berg and dyrud as . welsh bergs  portrays this tormented character more in line with the two tragic female characters  and . both women are like  trapped in political intrigues  by her ambitious father  and brother  and  as a political pawn for  her late husbands brother and murderer. welsh bergs  is caught in filial duty and affection for  and  yet driven by his own need to find truth. what the audience sees in welsh bergs  is a university educated philosopher who is captivated by his own psychology and intrigue. bergs clear focus on the characters mission allows her to create a  who is capable of almost following through on his plan of avenging the murder of his father. welsh berg maintains a calm and calculative demeanor suggesting that he could have become a fine king of den. welsh berg also illuminates a compassionate side of the character in the get thee to a nunnery scene. dyruds  is more volatile expressing his frustration anger and sorrow through gestures and movement. for example he swings his legs while talking to  and . he walks on the rails of the lower galleries as he speaks. he is so consumed by his emotion that he does not seem to keep track of his initial intention. this might be a more traditional interpretation of this tormented soul. david  smiths portrayal of  strikes me as a bit too nice a king without even a hint of viciousness. dougfred millers  who dresses like thomas cromwell with a tudor bonnet and lawyers gown is an elizabethan machiavelli. yet miller filled his lines with humor. he explains s condition to  m i swear i use no art at all. that he is mad tis true tis true tis pity.  preaches the playersthe best actors in the world either for tragedy comedy history pastoral pastoral comical historical pastoral  these lines drew laughter from the audience. laura perrottas  is cold and distanced giving the impression that the queen has given up her autonomy to s intrigue for a long time. erin partins  is at first reserved and composed but after she loses her mind due to her fathers death at the hand of  she becomes disheveled and incoherent. nick steen as  portrays a noble kinsman with intelligence and integrity. director  fee underscores the humor and absurdity in this tragedy. for example there are three instances in which  aled davies and  christopher tocco are asked by  to swear to secrecy. first  asks them to keep the sighting of the kings ghost lynn robert berg to themselves. second the ghost of king  in echoing voice makes them swear not to reveal anything they saw. then  makes  and  swear they will not reveal his plans for revenge. the ghosts thunderous voice and  and s bewilderment as well as the repeats of s invitation to secrecy invited laughter in both performances. set designer russell metheny re configured the hanna theatre a prosceniumthrust stage into the globe theatre by increasing the depth of the thrust stage and adding galleries onstage. with two chandeliers and multiple electric candle lights the stage becomes a replica of the sam wanamaker playhouse the globe theatres indoor theatre. when the chandeliers are raised the action is set outdoors. part of the audience is seated on stage in the first level gallery area which looks like a jury box giving the drama a courtroom feel. lighting designer rick martin uses blue and purple colors for some outdoor scenes suggesting the cold atmosphere of den in which something is rotten. great lakes theater unlike the globe uses recorded music sound designed by matthew webb to accompany the production mainly soft piano music including erik saties gymnopédies. kim krumm sorensons costumes evoke the aura of elizabethan period costumes also the tradition of the globe theatre. according to a program note sorensons inspiration ranged from tudor era portraits by court painter hans holbein to contemporary runway fashion which inspired her to design s simple white dress with a shawl. the traits of

Hamlet,Hamlet: In the Dark with Shades and Shadows,Michael Meigs,its undeniable  is dark. when we first see him the protagonist acknowledges to his mother his nighted color and replies that tis not only my inky cloak good mothernor customary suits of solemn black. but mourning garb is only a minor symbolic indication of the vast darkness that lies across this story. it starts on darkened battlements with a ghost and soon returns there and the darkness within mens souls is blacker and grimmer than any watch on the walls of elsinore. you wait for your escort at the museum of human achievement an anonymous repurposed warehouse near the raiilroad tracks in east austin. a mute cast member with a flashlight opens the entrance door and ushers you into a space of darkness that seems to extend forever. youll hear some rustling and muttering amongst the gathering audience and you may well be momentarily blinded by the glare of the flashlight function of an iphone clutched in someones nervous hand. in that setting you might well accept the offer of wine to settle your nerves. if not dont worry this lengthy production will give you chances to refresh during its two intermissions. led beams pierce the darkness as bernardo and  stand watch. its a fine and spooky effect. and when the battlements are cleared a constellation of hanging bulbs emerges overhead to situate you in the royal court. youre not going to experience this  as a perpetual mole in a hole although the darkness will wrap around you regularly enough. though there are plenty of shadows you will be able to see the action. director stephanie carll and a cast of seven present this first folio version. theres a certain formalism that rules the slightly curved arc of wall behind the playing space is divided into sections each lit from below and the actors sit or stand in those niches most of the time that theyre not engaged directly in the action. they shift characters with simple change of costume. and  is crowded with characters. for example judd farris is a solemn  but with a prance and a fedora he becomes  reagan tankersley is both  and . samuel grimes is an exacting  but quite different rough hewn aspects of him are lit by a miners headlamp as hes heard in the role of the gravedigger. illuminated opposite grimes as the assistant digger is amber quick who appears most of the time as a queen  to the manor born. hannah adrian the wan and distracted  wandering through the dark rows of the audience and handing out her faded flowers turns up after the burial as the fantastical courtier . director carlls humor comes through in the clever tweedledum and tweedledee presentation of  and guidenstern. their matched attitudes suspenders hats and movements reach just the edge of

Hamlet, A Decisive Hamlet in a Post-colonial World,Yuko Kurahashi,s inability to act and pursue vengeance for his fathers murder has long been a source of debate. the recent royal  companys production of  directed by simon godwin featuring black british actors takes a different approach. the play is set in an unidentified former british colony. while unnamed the locale may well be intended to represent ghana the former british colony which gained its independence in 1957. the program notes compare this dane to the prime minister of ghana kwame nkrumah who was deposed by a military coup in 1966. however this production should not be interpreted in reference to one nation or region because the character of  unleashes chaos and a loss of reason found not only in the political life of postcolonial africa but in other nations as well. the play is given a late twentieth century look with hanging banners a platform that is used as a stage for s actors s bed and a raised dais for two thrones and ikea style table and chairs to represent  home. the production also uses sound effects and spotlights to suggest a helicopter landing at the return  marcus griffiths. subtle details in props also emphasize specificity of time. in one scene for example  reads time magazine with an image of king  on the cover. without any further explanation the cover photo signifies the death of a good democratic leader to a contemporary audience. the casting of two white actors as  james cooney and  bethan cullinane connotates continued western involvement in the former colony. the production also has an afro caribbean flavor which is particularly evident in the scenes where the ghost of old  ewart james walters appears accompanied by two drummers in the upper galleries. the drummers under an orange light drum with their heads upward as old  appears in an african garb as though the power of the drums conjured him from the world of the dead. the afro caribbean atmosphere is also used to good effect in the duel between  and . the duel normally done as a fencing game is done in this production in the form of capoeira with sticks which makes the scene acculturated choreographed and stylized. it is the unusual portrayal of  that gives this production a truly modern flavor. he is driven by a desire for vengeance without regard for justice. paapa essiedu as  achieves  a strange state of self sacrificing religious inspiration to avenge his fathers death as an scholar ewan fernie writes in his program notes. this aspect is heightened with a ritualistic atmosphere through the use of african drums dance and costumes. this is not a  that continues to question essiedus  has a clear intention to kill  and to avoid imprisonment or execution. in pursuit of this aim  presents himself as a madman. essiedus mad  enjoys his role playing. he indulges himself in poetry music art and theatre but as a madman he has artistic license to insult  clarence smith  tanya moodie and  cyril nri through words attitudes and art. he does so by creating the uncouth painting of the serpent king and spray painting graffiti on the portrait of  and . s art is both a reflection of his true nature and feelings as well as a tactic in pursuit of his vengeance. it is against this madness of  that the madness of  natalie simpson becomes even more heart wrenching. it becomes clear its not just the despair of having lost her father that has driven her mad but also her fear of her own fate in this politically unstable kingdom. godwins ending is powerful and compelling. by this time  has caused enough of his own destruction including the death of  his mother  chief counselor to the king as well as polonious son  and daughter .  theo ogundipe closes the performance by entering and stepping over the corpses to sit on the throne. after experiencing this take of the story of  in a disorderly regime its left up to us to conclude if the king of norway will restore reason to the kingdom or the lone figure of  means the arrival of a new dictator. either way its a reable journey. ,5,Tragedy,Positive
Hamlet,Street Art and Anti-Psychology: The Wilma Theater's Hamlet,Jennifer Kramer,to note that people have a lot to say about  is akin to noting that the title character is rather talkative or that  is a well known english playwright. but s and s popularity   and thus familiarity   gives them an interpretive dimension that extends beyond quality of script and production and many talented artists have taken advantage of this to present an unconventional reading of the play with the confidence that the audience will recognize its conversation with the original. from the moment one enters the lobby of the wilma theater   filled with a history of actresses performing the title role layers upon layers of street art and notes about inspirations for the setting   it is clear that they too have a lot to say about  and the result is a thought provoking if occasionally puzzling production. zainab jah follows in the footsteps of centuries worth of actresses portraying  but her performance is uniquely her own. jahs  is earnest and decisive trying his best to manage the multitude of external conflicts besetting him. though his soliloquies reveal he is not free from internal conflict it is not his driving force. jah imbues  with an infectious energy and loosely leashed hyperactivity combined with her diminutive stature and the excision of references to  as a thirtysomething her  seems very young. but apart from his first appearance where the revelation that his mother will not let him return to school prompts a wordless gesture of shocked teenage outrage it is clear this  has been forced by events to grow up too quickly. jahs performance highlights the tragedy that  will never have a chance to enjoy the maturity hes been thrust into. jah is a good example of director blanka zizka anti psychological style   acting that focuses on  he imagination of the body rather than the psychology of the character. on the other end of the spectrum is  in a well executed but ultimately confusing turn by sarah gliko. the court of den seems fond of highly stylized movements somewhat jarringly accompanied by very loud new age y voice modulation and at first it seems like  has simply absorbed this as proper behavior. in scenes with the court and her father she proceeds around the stage in a stately glide a façade she drops when playfully farewelling her brother. however following s offstage visit to her closet her conversations with  and later  are punctuated by compulsive demi pointes swings and slow motion spins and falls somewhere between interpretive dance and catatonic waxy flexibility. one assumes her bizarre routine is her response to the stressful circumstances   except that none of the other characters react as if her behavior is anything but completely normal. even in the depths of her madness they are more shocked at her disheveled appearance and disordered speech than the fact that she can only stay upright with the help of a dance partner. glikos performance is even odder alongside the largely conventional performances of the rest of the cast like joe guzmáns excellent  while his funny and overbearing personality informs his actions in the play her actions do not seem to inform her character arc at all. vasilija zivanics costume design establishes the modern setting and subtly underscores the productions themes. the nearly monochromatic color palette hints at dens unbalanced nature and shifts alongside the plays trajectory at the beginning s black shirt pants and boots stand out against the white silver and grey formalwear of the court by the end of the play nearly everyone appears in black either in mourning or in the foreign uniform of norway. zivanics costumes for  and  draw on elements from haute couture to interesting effect. the formers flared cocktail dress has a distinctly modern collar and cut out bodice but its white color and silhouette in combination with s braided hair suggests she still possesses a childlike innocence. meanwhile s dresses combine the businesslike cut of a suit jacket with an appropriately regal cape of the sort featured by designers like tom ford and ralph lauren her in appropriately high leg slit however seems to owe itself to her ill advised and highly public passion for her new husband. nosing around the lobby of the wilma provides context for the set design by matt saunders on a recent trip to greece zizka was inspired by the political nature of street art and graffiti created by citizens protesting the states decline. with the help of cera and other local street artists saunders recreates that protest on the imposing walls lining the stage. within these walls unsheathed swords are plunged into the dark gravel that fills in the lower level of the stage and spills from the ceiling during the initial act breaks delivering an evocative impression of a nation disintegrating into anarchy and violence. the closest hint of order is s almost throne like chair downstage right amidst toppled piles of books under a bare bulb lamp. however rising above this is the portion of the set representing  court an enormous circular thrust stage extending from an imposing set of doors panelled in dark gold and drenched with light whenever the action takes place there. the truly massive set embodies the plays theme of order surrounded by   and succombing to   chaos a visual representation of something rotten in the state of den. the set also embodies one of the unintentional themes of zizkas production an intriguing concept with an underwhelming follow through. the gravel stops falling from the ceiling in the second half of the play though den is in just as much danger of collapse meanwhile zizka cuts both  reintroduction with his mob of supporters and  assessment of  as lovd by the distracted multitude eliminating a significant part of the textual evidence for the widespread political unrest. she does add some dystopian politics with the introduction of  and  thrown onstage with bags over their heads and clearly unaware that they were kidnapped by order of the king. the subsequent breakdown of their relationship with  finally leads to outright violence when they physically subdue him after  murder. however instead of using this to establish them as either  unwilling pawns or like minded allies their last scene onstage is ambiguously spent trailing after  in weary exasperation undercutting any resolution when the audience learns that  and  are dead. the production suffers from an artificial emotional distance caused by such dropped storylines mystifying character traits like s or technical complications the otherwise compelling interaction between the ghost lindsay smiling with a striking disconnect between the passion of his voice and a ghostly immobility of features and  is marred by the fact that thanks to the sheer size of the set dramatic lighting and an obscuring fog  is basically invisible and the audience must deduce his reactions solely from jahs voice acting. on the other hand jahs voice acting is quite good   there is no denying the quality of the production as a whole. while zizkas directorial choices occasionally prove frustrating it is because they stifle the development of the intriguing concepts she has introduced. the wilma theaters production of  is an ambitious attempt to push the bounds of an theatre to new heights of relevance and technique though the delivery may falter it is well worth listening to what its trying to say.,4,Tragedy,Positive
Hamlet,Hamlet in Kazakhstan,James Nikopoulos,on april 23rd s globe theatre kicked off its celebration of the 450th anniversary of the bards birth by embarking on what will be a two year tour performing  in every country in the world all 205 according to the globes last count. on the 27th and 28th of september they arrived in astana the capital of kazakhstan otherwise known as country number fifty. in the performance program artistic director dominic dromgoole refers to the globes transportable production of  a fitting epithet considering that most every aspect of the production from the props to the costumes to the music highlighted a traveling troupe theme. dromgoole does his best to make this theme explicit. the program reminds audiences that english theatre used to be about touring and nothing else while actor tom  announces just as the show is about to begin that the house lights will remain on for the duration of the performance as a way of mimicking the outdoor atmosphere of the globe. the effect of such a choice though is less an invocation of the globes inimitable ambience and more a reminder of the fact that we are here in this very different place and part of the world. such a choice reminds us that we are watching an itinerant troupe making due in a venue that is not its own. the role of  was shared by ladi emeruwa and naeem hayat. i can not comment on the formers performance since mr. hayat had the privilege of playing the lead on my night. so many actors fall prey to overacting crazy and the many young s of not so distant memory are no exception. but mr. hayat did not. i would not want to limit his artistry by implying that he had any specific performance in mind as a counterweight but at times it felt like his  was the anti kenneth branagh. what a breath of fresh air it was to hear those impossible six words the most famous in the english language according to the british ambassadors opening speech unburdened by all that baggage they have been loading onto their shoulders the last four and a half centuries. while branaghs throaty exhalations turned to be or not to be into the least believable line in his film mr. hayats rendition made of it into a running start as though implying that there is something much more exhilarating or worrisome to follow and isnt this the point of that soliloquy?. i found it to be in ed contrast to the way s like branaghs turn the line into celebratory spectacles not unlike the kind that break a bottle of champagne on a ships departing bow. the other actors were just as good. jennifer leong as  like mr. hayat brought a bit of understatement to that equally impossible role. even  dougall as  understated the pretentiousness of his character though without losing what makes  such a potentially funny performance. in talking to those students of mine who saw the performance on the following day it was mr. dougalls  that garnered the most unrivaled acclaim. i do not want to dwell on his performance for too long though but only because i feel like it would do an injustice to miranda foster as  and keith barlett as  both of whom also performed as their respective doubles in the play within the play while mr. barlett also incarnated the ghost of s father. with the exception of mr. hayat as  all the actors took on the responsibility of playing multiple roles as well as serving as the musicians who accompanied much of the action on a drum a recorder or the stringed instrument played by ms. foster that seemed to me like a cross between a banjo and a mandolin. the music contributed an important part to the productions transportable theme imbuing it with a spirit that was vaguely reminiscent of vaudeville. likewise with the props and the stage overall. the production stripped down the set to nothing more than a curtain hung on a couple pieces of wood and a series of traveling trunks that were moved around opened and reopened and shuffled into ever changing combinations almost as though pretending it were possible to turn ones luggage into chairs at times walls at others or even the grave from which a pensive young man pulls out his old jesters skull. as though the boxes on our backs could be used to bring to life the world we have just left behind. the reable nature of this aspect of the staging is that it stripped the play of the gravitas that has always seemed so fundamental to s tragedy. if part of the difficulty of staging  derives from the distance between the world it depicts and our own then you would think that a  so dependent on luggage and rope would lose something vital. but this was precisely where the directors mr. dromgoole along with bill buckhurst laid their greatest claim to insight. if  is really just the orestes story modernized through introspection as the italian playwright luigi pirandello said then its modernity should be able to withstand a setting that would make of its prince into a traveling pauper. i wondered if mr. dromgoole and mr. buckhurst had in mind pirandello considering that their rendition of the play within the play included a very puppet like mimed introduction pirandello likens  to orestes in his discussion of a marionette production of the orestes story during which the paper sky of the miniature theatre opens up to reveal a puppet masters hand. pirandello said this in a novel from 1904. it seems then that in 2014  is a fitting venue for bringing back bygone theatrical productions like puppet shows. though i have no idea if the directors had intended this. maybe they were thinking more of commedia dellarte and its own noble tradition of itinerant showmanship? im not sure but their  was certainly reminiscent of this tradition. by harping on the itinerant roots of english theater they are certainly invoking a time when audiences were used to seeing kings reduced to jesters and queens to puppets. this  though as i said earlier seemed to want to turn its heroes into vaudeville performers. all the actors were dressed in the kinds of slacks with suspenders and boots that made them seem more like extras from o brother where art thou? than elizabethans even if their costumes were consistently being touched up with articles from the period. before this performance i had never imagined just how well a a pair of overalls could be complemented by a renaissance doublet. likewise i never imagined an accordion could accompany a soliloquy so well. if the show was a bit of vaudeville it was vaudeville meets marlowe with a mad prince uttering vaguely recognizable lines throughout. and the audience definitely recognized  even if it didnt always understand it. after all its fame precedes it perhaps like no other work of art in the world. the shows sold out at least a month before the performances though it became increasingly clear that part of the reason had to do with corporate bodies buying up large chunks of tickets. which is why when only a couple weeks before the shows emails began to circulate amongst my colleagues we were more than a bit disheartened to learn we didnt have a shot in hell at getting tickets for our students let alone for ourselves. and then a miracle happened. the week of we learned that our university was one of these greedy corporate bodies. in a rather atypically just fashion the school even correctly determined which students would most appreciate the tickets and distributed accordingly. that i myself got to see it through a friend of a friend was sheer wonderfully dumb luck. the evening though was not without its road bumps. despite the fact that no one i knew had any luck trying to buy tickets about a quarter of the seats were empty when the show began. by the time the actors returned from intermission that number had swollen to about a third. perhaps much of this had to do with the inordinately bad weather that night bad even by astanas standards. a student of mine told me during the intermission that though she had bought her ticket independently a month earlier she considered not coming because of the rain. though it was disappointing to see so many empty seats especially after the break perhaps its unfair to judge. it is  after all. the friend of the friend who sold me my ticket turned to me during the intermission and said she never realized before how bad her english was. and this coming from a woman whose conversational english is flawless. i had assumed that the audience knew beforehand the extent to which s language is not ours just like i assumed that linguistic barriers were beaten down to a minimum because of the kazakh and russian titles that were being projected above the stage. to be or not to be may be the most recognized six words in the english language but theres a whole play that surrounds them that are decidedly less easy to decipher. this is why i wish they had shut the house lights. i understand what the directors were aiming for but there comes a moment in the play when the photographer snapping to your right and the children playing with their toys to your left affect every aspect of the performance including your sympathy for the actors. i kept thinking they traveled this far to perform in a theatre this empty. when we returned from the intermission i knew they knew that the theatre was more empty than before. i worried it would affect their performances. i worried that it would of all ridiculous things hurt their feelings. how could one guy in the audience no matter how enthusiastic be able to make up for two rows of seats that werent empty just an hour and a half ago? it didnt affect their performance though or at least it didnt in any way i could discern. however i do not want to give off the impression that only students and literature professors could have possibly enjoyed the show because there were moments that seemed to transcend any and all barriers erected by the language. two in particular the first came by way of that mimed introduction to s play within his play. before the troupe recited the mousetrap the actors playing the actors who are about to soliloquize the betrayal and murder of s father performed the whole thing through an exaggerated comic mime. the duped king walks out like a wooden mannequin and lies down to meet his death. the duplicitous queen gasps with feigned shock at the crime to be committed by her lover who has just emerged like some hobo mephistopheles prancing about with a prop meant to mimic the container from which he will pour the poison into the kings ear but which doubles as a kind of castanet. this is because the entire charade is played to the consistent beat of a lone drum being played by a member of the troupe. as the murderer pours out the poison he shakes the castanet like instrument downwards in rhythm to the beat. the king then dies a comically exaggerated death reminiscent of a puppet doing a tragically exaggerated an death. one leg shoots upwards he sits up like a jack in the box then his head swivels to the side. one arm is lifted up then down followed by the other as though he were on strings. and when its all done the queen and her murderer take to the front of the stage in a hilarious pas de deux that had the audience applauding uproariously. did you ever think  could be funny? i sure hadnt. but this is nothing compared to how the directors ended the production. you will recall  everyone dies. everyone pretty much at least. which is why i was surprised that the play the globe chose to travel the world with would be this most talkative of s revenge tragedies. why not a comedy? something to leave the audiences from those 205 countries in a better mood at the end of the night? even if sure a line like to thine own self be true is more well known than anything a character like  ever uttered. it seems though the directors did not feel that they had to make a genre choice for their finale because they refused to allow their audience any opportunity to appreciate the ending as tragic. picture the stage as it always is when  ends  undone  run through  as dearly departed as our mad prince a stage glutted with carnage. isnt this how it has to be for  to end correctly? apparently not so for not five not ten seconds after  and  have finished lamenting the bodies strewn around them than something unexpected happens. a fairy comes out. then another. now these are not real fairies. they are the other actors whose own untimely ends earlier in the show have left them backstage this whole time. thus the actress whom wed just mourned as  is back almost ethereal dancing across the stage to the rhythm of a tune being played by other actors. the audience has not let out a sound mind you. how could it? for there is no way anyone expected this. they didnt even allow us time to applaud all those deaths instead we get  a nymphs forest dance. she waltzes between the strewn corpses and curtseys downwards as though she were cinderellas godmother and though she has no magic wand a slight touch on the shoulder of one of the fallen others wakes him up almost as if from the dead. soon the actor who had been playing  is part of the dance. he touches . soon she is part of it too. the music gets more assertive. around and around we go the stage slowly denuding itself of carnage and filling up with what seem like the leftovers from last seasons production of a midsummer nights dream. soon the music is louder than it has been all show.  is up now too and he along with every single person sitting in the audience is enthusiastically clapping along to the beat that has overtaken the theatre. this goes on for some time and brazenly so. dont these actors realize we just sat through two hours and forty minutes of murder suicide and betrayal? of a kingdoms slow unraveling? dont they understand we want to applaud everyones demise and leave so we can go have our dinners? this is when the performance took on something unexpected for me. the traveling troupe theme makes sense makes so much sense that im sure i would have foreseen it had i bothered to think about it beforehand. how else are you going to take a show to every country in the world? that the actors would be stupendous  why should that have surprised me at all? but to have taken these itinerant professionals and turned them into the vaudeville performers the commedia dellarte troupes and shadow puppets of theatre history and to have done so in such a way as to give  an ending more apropos of one of s comedies? to imply that the spirit of tragedy should not be one of death but of resurrection?  was part of an unusually busy theatre weekend for me. the night before i saw a performance by british actors of the kazakhstani playwright dulat issabekovs play the transit passenger. at a certain point in that performance the lead actor expatiates on the extent to which kazakhs are connected to their homeland. or at least the extent to which they used to be how interesting to be in astana and hear these words spoken through a thick british brogue and then a night later in the same city to hear the four hundred and fifteen odd year old words of an englishman who in his whole life barely traveled 100 miles from his home town thats a little over 150 versts. because astana to so many people both from here and not seems like the edge of the world in an age of mass transport wouldnt the edges of the world have needed to move more inland?. personally i dont think kazakhstan feels like the edge of the world which is part of why i cannot sympathize with the sentiment of the villagers from above. what a fuss for what? isnt the quickest way to get home to go around the world first? i got the sense that taking  globe to globe is really all about this which is why the comic ending of the worlds most famous tragedy is making more and more sense to me these days. if  and all his minions had stayed dead we wouldnt be clapping along in a theatre in central asia. at most wed be picking at their bones like some long winded brat with too much time to kill and nowhere to go.,5,Tragedy,Positive
Hamlet,Overheard at Elsinore,Jennifer Kramer,for their traditional fall thriller the hedgerow theatre company has chosen to produce  and takes full advantage of this classic choice even as their production is far from merely traditional. the most obvious change is the setting now moved to the late nineteenth century. as director dan hodge notes the formality of dress and a rigor of social expectation seems to fit the royal court in this piece but there is also allowance for romance and thrilling intrigue. this aesthetic is echoed readily in sarah mitchells costume design where bold colors and rich fabrics denote the wealth of the court of den. s formal gown of gold is edged with inches of lace complementing  tie and red waistcoat beneath his restrained grey suit  suit and tails are an arresting dark green. younger members of the court like   and  wear long jackets and loud patterns and  stands out in her velvet dress of dark fuchsia. even  in the more conservative dress of a gentlewoman scholar wears a striking dark teal gown before donning a soft pink blouse and long gray skirt. visually interesting on its own the overall design scheme also makes  in his simple black mourning suit stick out even more. in contrast zoran kovcics set design is deliberately minimalist. a platform with two matching half flights of stairs raises the back half of the stage and a slender staircase rises up to the balcony on stage right both painted a chilly slate blue. its an excellent showcase for elaborate human drama and indeed this is the focus of the production. the action begins with the introduction of jennifer summerfield as  given somewhat unusual though welcome prominence. summerfield ably demonstrates the mental toll of the turmoil in den even on outsiders despite her attachment to  and its interestingly ambiguous nature  is frightened and nearly overwhelmed by the ghost the harassment of the mad  and  blatant intimidation as events escape his control. in contrast annette kaplafkas  begins the play as a confident young woman who is then brought low by her own mental tortures. when  claims that love has driven  mad kaplafka clearly shows  taking this to heart a reaction that is only reinforced when she witnesses the suicidal mood of his to be or not to be and his subsequent and apparently genuine unhinged raillery against womans perfidious nature. assuming that responsibility thus makes her feel culpable for s exile and ultimately the death of her father. powerful on their own the production sets off these darker moments with a strong current of levity. zoran kovcics excellent comic timing is fully exploited in his performances as both the grave digger and  while still imbuing the latter with a sense of pathos for his eventual fate. likewise brock d. vickers and joel guerrero respectively humanize the hapless  and  while amusingly toadying it quickly becomes apparent that they are far out of their league making s retribution at best ambiguously deserved. however the best example of this balance of humor and darkness is jared reeds  who flips from sardonic to disturbed at the slightest provocation. reed plays  as a troubled man who is not so much concealing his issues behind a façade as realizing he has little control over the eruption of his own violent potential. depression overtakes him easily enough and his rage bursts out at the wrong moments never towards his intended target humor no matter how dry or black is the one emotion over which he retains mastery. hodge shows no compunction at trimming the text in this production one must rely on the actors and atmosphere to determine that somethings rotten in the state of den. the streamlined script works well and even allows for some additional dialogue by    for example scolds  with one of friar laurences from  and  after s outburst at s funeral lending her a more appropriate narrative weight now that she opens and closes the play.  cuts to the cast also yield some interesting results as  himself plays lucianus in the mousetrap making obvious his hostility to  and also somewhat excusing his horrific theater etiquette during the production. hodge also adds layers of complexity to the intrigue as characters repeatedly overhear information of which they are normally unaware.  witnesses the depths of s despair in his most famous soliloquy  observes  suspicious determination to send  away  catches wind of  and  sinister designs. one does wish there was slightly more follow through on the role of the ghost  lopes whose startling resemblance to his brother  also  lopes and supernaturally violent treatment of  raises a great many questions that the production chooses not to explore. however there is more than enough horror arising from the mortal world as relationships fray and deeds become increasingly dire. hodge notes i found that this is true of every character they each share a humanity that has great potential to arrest our attention even today.

Hamlet,iHamlet at the Philly Fringe,Jennifer Kramer,in philadelphia fringearts is one of the local organizations dedicated to supporting showcasing and expanding the citys art community   a mission annually capped off with their city wide festival. for 2014 the philadelphia  theatre offers their production of i. this modern adaptation by robin malan explores the play almost solely through s lines and the distillation of s tragedy allows director david oconnor and star melissa dunphy to portray the evolution of s internal conflict as a riveting one woman show.like the text itself the staging is strikingly stripped down. the set consists of an old fashioned armchair and a single large and ornately framed mirror suspended upstage contrasting with the humble wooden table holding all of s stuff on the now barren thrust stage of the philadelphia  theatre. dunphys silver dyed hair lip piercing and tattoos are the only augmentations for s simple contemporary dress the prince of den spends the majority of the production in black jeans sneakers and a charcoal tank top quickly ditching a black blazer and eventually donning a grey hoodie.dunphys  would be an achievement in a traditional production in i she effortlessly transforms the compilation of s lines into what is essentially an hour long soliloquy. dunphy deftly articulates the mental and philosophical effects of s many conflicts sans external stimuli while ensuring that s reactions are relatable and recognizable. her  is not sensationally mad but is clearly troubled suffering from depression manic episodes and anxiety exacerbated by the turbulent environment in which he is embroiled. dunphy handles his mood swings with aplomb allowing the flow of his thoughts to skip between differing often violently opposed emotions while still maintaining a natural progression. her  who begins the production back to the audience moodily playing exercises and fragments of songs on his  later addresses them quite comfortably in many slyly funny asides or as stand ins for his friends. he reads his love letter to  with a sardonic self deprecation rages at the perfidy of women and weeps piteously at her grave. after  death he quickly covers his chagrin with a string of wordplay and a musical pastiche but reacts to the abrupt appearance of yoricks skull being tossed on stage with contemplative discomfort. he seems genuinely moved by the ghosts plight bloodthirsty to revenge  treachery filled with self loathing that he cannot muster the mental reserves to carry out his fathers charge at last he achieves an inner calm in his the readiness is all speech. in dunphys portrayal  is still very much  when all else has been stripped away but words words words.oconnors direction strikes a good balance between allowing s thoughts to range unfettered and subtly augmenting the productions metatextual nature. the production begins with the first of many unexpected and thus appropriate renditions of the time is out of joint which trails off into confusion  berates himself to speak the speech  trippingly on the tongue and attempts a number of his famous soliloquies then gives an entertaining nod to the productions title by consulting his iphone on the frequently contested phrase too too sullied flesh. siri incidentally comes down firmly on the side of the first folio with did you mean solid flesh? for all that s are the only words and actions oconnor maintains a sense of ambiguity as to whether the events of s play are happening concurrently in some metaphorical way or only in s head. sinister echoes of the  herald supernatural episodes.  sees the ghost in the blinding glare of the spotlights which cast everything else into shadow while his greeting of ill call thee  is addressed directly into the mirror eliciting any number of interesting interpretations.it is the betrayal of this ambiguity otherwise consistently maintained that mars the ending. having come to a sort of resigned peace with himself and his circumstances realizing the readiness is all and at last completing the time is out of joint o cursed spite that ever i was born to set it right both  and the audience are ambushed by the climax of the play  collapses in agony from an apparent stab wound uttering only a single choice expletive before dying. to be killed by an invisible assassin eschewing  poison denied a chance to revenge himself on  and then dragged off by that fell sergeant death without managing to get in the last word or rather 227 of them seems out of character for both  and the production as a whole. s shocking end does not appear to offer any commentary on s play or the action of the previous hour a us choice for an adaptation that until now has remained in close conversation with the original text.but this odd swerve does not detract from the quality of the rest of the production. the fringe festival is meant to serve as the culmination of provocative contemporary work in philadelphias art community and dunphy and oconnors i certainly qualifies. their fine transformative work says much about the original echoing s words in its own modern voice.,5,Tragedy,Positive
Hamlet,A Happier Hamlet (?),Melissa Crismon,as the sun sets and the full moon rises in tree lined rossmoor  by the seas  goes through many moods. even though the production begins and ends sadly with death there is a lot of funny in between. the full length  is over four hours long but director stephanie coltrin has shortened it to two hours by focusing on the internal politics since the acting troupe is in a park setting. it feels like the complete play with the memorable parts like the ghost the romance between  and prince  the play within the play that is close to the circumstances to the dead king the skull found by the gravediggers and the duel between  and . the performance is done in period. the only part that may appear contemporary is the backdrop on the stage which coltrin says could be ten years old. its all about stretching the budget but a high quality performance and hard work by all the actors and staff make up for any short comings. the stage is entirely black with two posts in the foreground torn black material waving in the wind. side steps lead to the stage with another level in front of the creatively used background designed by aaron jackson. a large square frame is a broken mirror communicated by wood cut in the shape of spider cracks. a glossy clear material fills some of the mirror for the pieces that didnt crack. behind the mirror  spies on  and the ghost speaks to him. in scenes that require half the cast the colors of the costumes coordinate with the use of silver and black adding purples blues and pinks for warmth. costume designer christa armendariz uses bright colors for the group of traveling actors. one is wearing yellow orange and red vertical stripes.  wears a soft pink dress with a blue bodice. the sleeves have a sheer pink sleeve with some of the blue brocade material from the bodice and then ending with cream lace around the wrists.  wears an iridescent silver dress. small diamond shapes create a pattern on the material. those who frequent sbts productions may recognize cylan brown as . this is his fifth year touring with the ensemble. he is enjoyable to watch in fight scenes where he can be caught practicing before the show. browns  is a balance of drama and comedy. his relationship with   delgado is sweet in the short time they have before he feigns madness. at one point he is seen walking through the park reading as a friend holds a lamp for him. the use of the parks expanse is amusing and engs the audience. the ghost masked with sheer silver material staggers through the audience as a deep voice speaks.  nick fawwaz is a concerned brother of s and also a funny player king in the group of traveling actors. s father   m. howell is a rhyming comic relief with great comedic timing. kristina teves s mother plays a convincing  as she smugly says the lady doth protest too much. jay castles  cant be bothered by his relations as he schemes against  using .  isnt a likeable character as castle and teves are caught kissing appearing shallow with no remorse of the loss of their king. eventually castle is a guilt ridden  as he storms out of the play within a play. tyler gray as the player queen speaks in a high pitched voice kissing the hands of the player king. delgado  is distraught as she speaks in a sweet voice walking along giving many in the cast a flower not making sense. clearly she has gone mad but we dont see her drown instead there is a funeral and burial.  fawwaz challenges  to a duel as he blames  for his sisters death. there is a short duel as  and  are quickly hurt but mostly different motives of the characters play out with the poisoned wine and rapier. it makes for an exciting duplicitous ending.  by the seas  is dramatic humorous romantic and action packed. this play has potential for being dark but this production is fast paced with plenty of comic relief.,4,Tragedy,Positive
Hamlet,I Am Hamlet,Jennifer Kramer,as a prelude to their summer production the delaware  festival spent april and may touring classrooms visiting retirement homes holding essay contests conducting interviews collecting insights via social media and even holding a town hall meeting as part of the i am  project their quest to capture what  means to the community the modern reflection of the diverse audience that  once wrote for. their own character focused production chases that broad appeal highlighting the relatable emotions within an extraordinary plot. the most notable feature of the production is the undercurrent of anger that runs through many of the actors performances an obvious reaction to the personal and public disruptions den keeps encountering.  carl granieri seems content with his rule and his family until  uncovers his treachery whereupon he retaliates with extreme prejudice the ghost michael gamache wanders aimlessly until  names him and gives him a voice which he immediately uses to rail against his fate. but griffin stanton ameisens energetic if line fumbling  is the clearest example of this his madness is all an act one that imperfectly covers his ire. he is driven first by frustration and discontent then a growing sense of rage when his uncles perfidy is revealed. but his interactions with  clare mahoney reveal a tenderness that while sacrificed to uphold his role of madman nevertheless suggests his cynicism and belligerence are a result of circumstance rather than temperament. in contrast to  who starts the play in a state of vexation mahoney portrays  as a sheltered yet lively girl whose trust in her loved ones leads to her downfall.  belief that s intentions may not be honorable clearly wounds her but she obeys his commands to push  away she is desperately confused by s antic disposition but perseveres in trying to soothe him even when she is terrified. her madness is the genuine reflection of s pretence she acquires the same energy and rage as she runs amok going so far as to violently hurl her flowers at  and  the authority figures who have let her down. oona curleys abstract set perfectly captures dens unrest. an escher like irregular archway looms over the levels of tilted asymmetric polygons that comprise the stage. the midnight blue archway is set with random slashes of translucent white which allow light effects to punctuate the supernatural occurrences though not always as in sync with the action as one would hope. christiaan clarks score supports the moody atmosphere paul gianakons performance on cello alternating between discordant and mournful. amanda wolffs costume design seems more a reflection of what den used to be an orderly though not uncreative place in an ahistoric past. the men wear colorful doublet like vests over shirtsleeves and long pants with the guards in matching navy uniforms and black berets. the women wear long gowns s white and s pink sporting wide sleeves and leather belts. the costuming is eye catching but not distracting and there are several smart details the ghost wears almost mummy like ragged white clothes and a headdress beneath his armor and crown s orange lined magenta stole matches  shirt s schoolmates  and  wear the same style vest as he does though in red and blue instead of inky black. if there is one flaw with the production it is that it lacks the energy its undercurrent of anger would suggest. it seems to be a problem of contrast the atmosphere is not stifling enough to make s restlessness stand out but neither is there a foil to set off his internal and external conflicts. intriguing character interpretations are introduced and then left to fizzle    caroline crocker for example apparently believes enough of s accusations to start mistrusting and shying away from  but director david stradley does not seem to have a clear payoff in mind for her final scenes. conversely the distinctly ominous appearance of  stephen keebler seems more like a last minute plot twist than a foreshadowed doom. stradleys den churns with a simmering discontent that never quite boils over. which is not to say that the pacing lags   on the contrary stradley keeps the action moving at a steady clip. he also attempts to maintain a balance between the plays dramatic and comedic elements with the french accented pomposity of  james kassees the frat boy enthusiasm of  ny smith the player troupes amused tolerance of s shenanigans and the black humor of the gravedigger michael gamache all providing welcome levity. in contrast to the abstract set and vague setting stradley focuses on emotional realism which nicely offsets the player troupes stylized performances of the pyrrhus speech and the mousetrap. stradleys vision may not be instantly iconic but the delaware  festival offers a well rounded production to the community crowding rookwood park. from the intrigued thirteen year old who asks dude whats he smoking? to the volunteer who attempts to explain the plot with have you seen the lion king? to the picnic goers who come prepared with their own prop skull it is clear that  continues to catch the attention of new and old audiences each with their own interests and interpretations.,4,Tragedy,Positive
Hamlet,All Denmark's a Forest,J. A. Macfarlane,full disclosure i have in the past worked with the director studied under  and acted with  who remains an excellent friend. for some years now frederictons bard in the barracks company has moved from presenting  in the downtown barracks to putting them on in odell park. this may not seem so shocking a move after all there are plenty of  in the park troupes out there. but odell park is not a tame park rather it is a spot of woodland in the middle of the city traversed by paths and not containing an amphitheatre. and director len falkenstein takes full advantage of all the forest has to offer scenes are site specific and the audience has to walk through sometimes treacherous terrain to reach the next stage. the plays therefore take place in much wilder settings than could otherwise be achieved   though naturally the fascinating possibilities this opens up also bring with them their own set of problems to be solved. this is particularly so in the case of  which is not like the companys previous choice of play for the park.  loves labours lost king lear the tempest and most obviously a midsummer nights dream are all fairly self evident as woodland shows. only as you like it is missing possibly because it was performed in the companys early years when they still performed in the eponymous barracks. but  is not only a claustrophobic play it is a very interior one. moving it from the enclosed prison of the castle at elsinore carefully guarded by nervous sentries to what can feel like an endless forest appears quite quixotic. falkenstein is clearly aware of this and deals with the issue ably enough by setting the play within a travelling culture somewhat akin to the roma and the irish travellers and while this produces its own contradictions it is a handy enough destabilisation from the clichéd renaissance court to match the lack of castle. better yet the fact is not played up the way that some productions overwhelm the play with the concept thats been found with it. in fact were it not for half of the audience getting to see s caravan one might suspect that only the players were travellers or that the various caravans serving as set were simply subtly referencing the historical existence of travelling players and linking this outdoors performance to that tradition   which would be a perfectly valid decision. but s caravan with its teakettle boiling outside lets half of us know that these caravans are to be taken for what they are   that they are dare we say true to themselves. but only half of us. for beyond destabilising us by placing us in a wood and forcing us to walk through it occasionally in the dark falkenstein goes further and cleaves the audience in two. a variety of intriguing philosophical ideas are advanced in the programme as an explanation for this but one cannot help but suspect that time had more to do with it.  is after all a very long play and four hours is a very long time to stand or sit in the woods this decision lops an hour off the playing time. however it may be half of the audience known as the 2b group follows  throughout the play while the other namely not2b see everything else. this is undoubtedly the most unique feature of the production. it is also its greatest flaw. it is an intriguing experiment but in the end i think a failure. certainly it allows for interesting effects the half of the audience that does not see s encounter with the ghost is left as confused by his actions and apparent madness as are the members of the court while those who follow  share his shock at s death and s reappearance in den assuming of course that they havent read the synopsis or that their memory of the plot is hazy. and as one of the actors was overheard saying the division of the play streamlines character arcs allowing them to become much clearer. this is perfectly true and doing this is a valuable rehearsal technique but the balance of the play is lost. usly  loses his consistency when all of his scenes are played one after the other. the audience has no time to assimilate his alterations nor to consider and wonder what he will do next and so he simply becomes confusing. for the 2b group following the prince wherever he goes unless the play has him off stage there is no sense of dallying or delay on his part. things happen rapidly   and therefore a soliloquy such as oh what a rogue and peasant slave am i lacks all its sense. by not seeing  and s concern over the prince before his encounter with  we have no idea that time has passed since he saw the ghost a short walk through the woods ago. falkenstein openly admits in his programme note to operating under the assumption that everyone in the audience other than his nine year old daughter at least until opening night knows the story anyway and that we therefore do not miss too much by missing an hour of the show. but this splitting of the audience is the only experimental element of the production the only way in which it is deconstructed the rest is quite traditionally done within the bounds of the setting and however intriguing the details. and these details can be intriguing for instance as 2b follows  towards the start of the play we pass by one of the guards bawdily singing one of s mad songs. it is effective in getting across the fact that s songs are vulgar but the point is entirely lost given that this group does not witness s madness while not2b who do are not given this equivalent to an explanatory footnote.  in fact is the great victim of this audience splitting as though the poor girl doesnt suffer enough as it is the 2b group simply never gets to know her and is therefore in no position to mourn her. moreover the whole patterning of the play is broken. seeing the play in this fashion emphasises how well constructed it is something that our familiarity with the story often leads us to forget.  always earned the wright in his job description and his plays are exceedingly well plotted. here just as s delay vanishes for half the audience and the other remains ignorant that he has a mission the counter examples to this delay and mission lose all their vigour.  in particular is nothing more than a bit part in the opening scene for 2b his status as a worried brother is unknown not to mention his function as a foil to  the proper revenger who shows up s tergiversations by demonstrating how a revenger should act bursting into s presence with no care for his own safety only the desire to murder. in only seeing him at his sisters funeral this aspect vanishes   we assume it is over her that he howls not that he returned to den for the sake of avenging his father meanwhile the half of the audience that has witnessed s return is essentially unaware of s discomfiture over his own dithering such as it is though by this point not2b is aware of s crime and that  somehow knows of it. the thematic structure of the play is disjointed. this is not to say that exceptional effects are not occasionally produced. for instance s funeral procession   all the more dramatic for being augmented by half the audience   slowly emerging from the woods behind the gravediggers bone bestrewn ditch its chime ed dirge matching the borne candles is a lovely moment while those in the procession get to see  give the poor yorick speech in the distance as they move towards him. this the most visually emblematic and recognisable scene in the play if not in all of drama brings not2b up to date and concretises the latent possibilities of the audience split if a little late in the proceedings. it puts one in mind of many a moment in tom stoppards  and  are dead an effect heightened by the earlier use of a use from the latter play to fill a gap in time while waiting for  and his half of the audience to arrive   producing some possibly intentional comedy as the prince is announced as being alone while in fact being followed by a troop of fifty or seventy people many bearing lawn chairs. but that is the only such meta theatrical moment that i noticed and it seems to me that for the division of the audience to work there should have been more. as it is there is almost no communication between the actors and the spectators. even the soliloquies are addressed to an invisible interlocutor rather than taking advantage of the possibility of speaking directly to the people who are listening to you anyway and whose concentration is almost entirely on you except for the bit concerned with slapping mosquitoes. this is true even at the very beginning of the play when  opens the main action with o that this too too solid flesh would melt a rearrangement of the text ill get back to. by not further integrating the audience opportunities are lost and raised eyebrows fill the gap. this is particularly true for 2b though the experience of seeing only those parts of the play directly concerning  does much to support the suspicion that in many ways the prince is actually the least interesting character in the play. though the phrase  without the prince may be proverbial like all of s plays  is in fact a group piece and it is a pity that another casualty of the division is the sense of ensemble among the cast. of course no production of any play can offer up all the possibilities of a text on stage but i am not certain that bard in the barracks provides enough to make up for the losses. it ends up seeming in the main unfair to the audience who loses half the story unfair to the actors whose best work may be unseen by half the audience and unfair to the play not to mention unfair to the mosquitoes who are left bereft of a full extra hours fine dining. let us take  as an example. sharisse lebrun is at her best in her early scenes with  and  and in her mad scenes   all of which are witnessed only by the not2b group. her amused toleration of her fathers foibles her mildly rebellious description of her relationship with  her somewhat pouty but not crushed and not necessarily believable acceptance of s reprimands are all subtly and charmingly accomplished. in her madness she trembles on the edge of sanity her quasi reasonableness all the more devastating in its contrast with her outbursts and screams and prettily sung songs. yet all this is hidden from the 2b group whose only knowledge of her relationship with  is the pre show where they are seen canoodling under a tree and  gives her the favour she seeks to return   but this is easily missed or forgotten. 2b only truly see  in the nunnery scene which is lebruns weakest. her reactions there do not seem to match s actions   a prime example of the lack of ensemble i mentioned earlier. both speak   and act   their parts but do not act off one another. it is also rather less than credible that  would be quite so calm in the mousetrap scene when  lies his head against her given that the last time they saw one another he attempted to strangle her. 2b therefore dismisses both  and lebrun. members of not2b on the other hand take this scene in their stride and forgive it entirely following the mad scenes. it is appropriate that they should follow s body to the grave and if that was lebrun herself and not a mannequin congratulations to her willingness to be carried over the less than smooth terrain leading to the graveyard and they will applaud more loudly than do the others. s family at home also demonstrates the infelicities produced by the double stream performance. as mentioned earlier while it does streamline character arcs it also produces a speed in each stream which makes nonsense of the plot. here for instance once  agrees to no longer see  again she is gone just long enough for  to send off  standing in for  to spy on  before she is back having had her mute encounter with  and received a number of text messages from him. given that  has only just met the ghost   in 2b we in fact witness the dumb show which i must admit i think is a mistake the scene has to be acted out exactly as  describes it and even olivier didnt manage to make that look anything other than ridiculous   this is a time problem on the level of s. it is this speeding up of the plot itself that gives credence to the thought that the main reason for the double stream is to save an hours time while cutting as little as possible. the choice as to what is cut on the hand are somewhat bizarre. it is fascinating to see probably the most easily and most often cut passage in    namely the unexplained details about lamord the french fencer   still remain while the ghost is almost gone. here falkenstein gives in to a tendency in productions that i admit sets me on edge people are often embarrassed by the ghost and try to remove him as much as most possible from the play. but  is first and foremost a ghost story and it is odd to see a company that put on the most witch ridden production of  ive ever seen coming so close to eliminating the supernatural altogether. but then one cant have the ghost appear in the closet scene when half the audience is unaware that there is a ghost. the ghost scene that survived does at least provide one of the two most effective uses of the park in the play along with the gravediggers ditch. picking up on the warning that the ghost might be leading  to the edge of a precipice the conversation between the prince and his father takes place on the very edge of a precarious twenty foot drop   above the audience. there is no better way to show just how dangerous the precipice actually is than to have us staring up riveted to the actors shoes in the hopes that they wont make a false step and splatter at our feet. the scene is though severely cut and unfortunately not very spooky. one must admit that its hard to make a lovely woodland scene spooky when there are still 90 minutes till sunset but the lack of menace is disappointing. without the opening ghost scene a very truncated version of which may be seen as you arrive there is no set up for the ghosts arrival and therefore precious little atmosphere while s neurosis appears out of nowhere as does his rant against drunkenness. incidentally it should perhaps be noted that given that theyre father and son if the ghost pronounces it ado s probably shouldnt say adieu. or the other way round. however though the textual choices made weaken the production they do not do so mortally thanks to the performances offered. though they do not coalesce as one might wish individually they are often very fine.  ball as  is particularly memorable. he gives us a charming  enraptured with his own euphuistic eloquence as delightfully unaware of his own hypocrisy as of the rolled eyes and heavy sighs that both his children and his monarchs give behind his back   but only behind his back. productions that overemphasise s more questionable aspects   his constant spying for instance   often forget that s eulogy for him spoken in the shock of his death calls him the good old man. one can clearly see why she would think so here however exasperating his overflow of words may have been and however much of an aging libertine trying to vicariously recapture his youth through his son he is. he seems everybodys slightly wacky uncle rather embarrassing at times   one shudders to think of the cringe worthy speech hed give at his daughters wedding   but still worthy of respect and generally good natured. filling out the  family is jesse lapointe as . it is an interesting choice rather than a happy go lucky playboy or a stuck up prig two of the more common interpretations  is a less than eloquent young man lost in a world of vigorously verbalisers an awkward jock who manages to make us feel sorry for him as he tries to give good advice to his sister without using coarse language. lapointe bellows well in his rage and the physicality of his anger is convincing. when he grapples with  in the grave he is reduced to animalistic roars that are shocking in this verbose and language concerned play ably demonstrating the depths of his sorrow and rage and his straightforward simplicity. in his parting scene with  we see him search for his words as he tried to caution her about  here it is confirmed that as someone else once said he cannot heave his heart into his mouth. matthew chiasson makes the most of his time as  particularly thanks to his taking s place. like a perfect courtier he seems to be everywhere at once and one can only hope that chiasson knows a good masseur to save his neck from the effects of his endless nodding. alas the opportunities with his hat are lost not least because  is not wearing one in that scene as he should. the general hat wearingness of the men at the start of the play had given me hopes but twas not to be. those other two spies of s the wannabe courtiers  and  were a delight. credibly interchangeable jean michel cliche and david smith did justice to the dimness of their characters as well as a fine turn as actors in the stoppard play. im not sure ive ever seen it so clearly laid out that the two are not only out of their depth in politics but are also very poor philosophers. cliche and smith give the distinct impression of having been on the debating team in school and being used to being bested by  there. certainly they do not appear to deserve their deaths and it was appropriate that on hearing of their execution alex donovans beatnik s outburst of why what a king is this is clearly a comment on the sort of king  would make. donovan does his best with an ungrateful role that all too often serves only to provide an excuse for more exposition made yet more ungrateful by the fact that not2b essentially first meets him just before the mousetrap. s reaction to s death is rather over the top considering whats come before. s assessment of him as not passions slave is revealed as somewhat incorrect. there are in fact several over the top moments in the production the actors often choose to go for displaying emotion rather than trying to evoke it in the audience. a prime example here is michael holmes lauders pimped up    gold chains fedora sunglasses and gaudy rings   whose oh my offense is rank can only be described as shatnerian   not to mention coming out of nowhere as there is no sign of remorse in him beforehand and no pause for introspection before he begins. otherwise holmes lauder offers an intriguing  mildly sleazy but good with people all the same. were never entirely certain of why he murdered his brother and took the crown   whether it was for  or for the sake of power or what   but certainly he has a close relationship with his wife. whether he cares for anybody else remains uncertain and in the later parts of the play he approaches moustache twirling villainy that could be toned down but certainly we see no reason to think that hes bad at his job. with her bird of paradise crest of hair slightly too much makeup and dress sense teetering on the edge of tackiness  rebekah chassé was wonderfully constructed and chassés performance is a highlight of the evening not least due to her subtlety and her willingness to make time for silence. she gives us a woman who has everything she needs to be happy except for the fact that her son will not be happy for her. her lack of patience with jake martins pouting  occupied most of the first half of the play gertuds clear love for her son being overborne by her exasperation with him. in a culture where one might expect men to grow up young  does not seem to be willing to a factor helped by martins rather youthful voice and by the start of the closet scene  has clearly had enough. it is noticeable that during the mousetrap scene it is  who is made uncomfortable by the play until its very end and s questioning whether the play is offensive is entirely on her behalf.  here is an independent women in a culture that does not quite accept the fact she is clearly irritated at being asked to leave the room when  has business and her decision to drink at the very end of the play is as much because  told her not to as from thirst. one has the sense that  has done her duty and now feels that she is allowed some freedom which her son wishes to deny her unlike  whom she eventually takes under her wing she refuses to think nothing   and her progressive breakdown after  accuses  of murder is an impressive bit of acting. she clearly begins to see the truth and her hesitation and growing isolation   culminating in s death which leaves her entirely alone   add relief to a character too often passively played. the queens passage from righteously angry to distraught to utterly shattered as her world is pulled down around her is beautifully done and a welcome change of pace in a production where characters often stay the same throughout. i was in fact surprised that her drinking the poisoned cup was not a deliberate suicide which is what i thought the characterisation was aiming towards. i must also give this production full s for allowing me to fulfil one of my life long dreams namely that of seeing a production of the play where the closet scene involves neither a bed nor  dry humping his mother. with freud banished the relationship between the two is gratifyingly non erotic and i think therefore much more interesting.  rejects the proposition that as a mother she should live only through her child rather than have a life of her own. while she diagnoses her son as being bothered by her oerhasty marriage to  she shows not the faintest jot of remorse over having done so. she makes it perfectly clear that she thinks  should grow up.  clearly has issues with this. but then  has issues with everything and martin makes him unstable from the start. we first see him sitting beneath a tree with  before the show starts happily chatting this is when  receives his favour. yet he moves immediately from this to oh that this too too sullied flesh would melt opening the play with this soliloquy. how he passes from his evident happiness in s company to his most blatantly suicidal speech is unexplained and i admit that i think this transposing of scenes   the court scene following the soliloquy rather than the other way round   is a mistake in that  announces he is isolated before he is shown to be instead of demonstrably being isolated and then commenting on the fact. still martin is to be commended for his willingness to open with one of the soliloquies a feat rather akin to the tenor having to sing celeste aida in verdis opera with barely a few bars of warmup. and he is even more to be applauded for taking on the role while being shorn of all the usual breathing spots that allow actors to get through this monstrously long part. true at times one feels that martins energy is being channelled into stamina rather than into the performance but that is understandable it is still a feat especially when one considers that after having gone through the entire play without a break  is faced with a very vigorous duel on uneven ground. intriguingly though martin is at his best when  is angry and yelling his  is a very weak man. the extent of his trauma even before he meets the ghost strikes the audience as excessive. clearly he wishes to return to wittenberg simply to get away from the situation and when this is refused one feels he is primed to grab on to the ghosts story simply because it allows him to change his thoughts. certainly the audience has no great wish to see this  become king he gives no reassurance that he would be a good one. martin does his best to work through s intellectual journey despite the difficulties strewn in his path by the production as discussed above   not least its speed. but along with his anger he is particularly good at s comic side. it is a nasty comic side and were not sure whether it suggests what  may have been like before his father died but it is both present and welcome. the nastiness of his jokes is part of another fine aspect of the performance it is never hidden that  is rather a jerk and were left uncertain why  and  care for him so much. no one else seems to even his mother appears to love him rather than like him. of course it is particularly difficult for the not2b group to emphasise with him just as 2b is not particularly fussed about . further humour is provided by ian goffs gravedigger ably assisted by  ball. goff does an excellent job of getting across the sometime obscure jokes and his utter lack of respect   though less shocking that it might be were s court not as casual as it is   is greatly enjoyable. the other outsiders   other than  whose role is difficultly fathomed in performance and who therefore becomes even more baffling when most of the references to him are split between the groups   are the players who bring a welcome touch of liveliness and colour into the rather dour atmosphere of the rest. unconstrained they dance sing and summersault about the brightly tinted skirts of the three ladies a particular visual relief. they also provide a lovely play in the old style with the nice touch that the part of the king in the the mousetrap is taken by devin luke who also plays the ghost and accompanied by intriguingly atonal improvised flute music they also introduce us to the hungarian roma song that serves as both leitmotif and final chorus to the play. but their most memorable part is the entertainment they provide during intermission 15 minutes of fooling around dancing and singing not even necessarily very well but out of the sheer desire to do so. it is a liberating scene   and having seen it twice i am impressed at how closely what appears to be improvised teasing and horseplay is reproduced each night. elizabeth goodyear who takes the part of the first player delivers one of the highlights of the evening with her performance of aeneass tale to dido. goodyear is the only cast member to truly speak the verse and performs the speech in the grand style without overdoing it at least until the end. i have long contended that this speech could be and ought to be truly moving in the hands of a gifted actor rather than the hammy and truncated set piece it is usually played as and goodyear comes very close to proving my point. a few other details of note mike son deserves high praise for his design and construction of the various wagons used in the production while in their role as fight directors jean michel cliche and len falkenstein are to be as commended as the fighting actors themselves  and . one does wish though that the company would rethink the direction of its poster design an opinion i have held for several years. the childrens book feel of this years would not have brought me to the ticket booth had i not already known the companys excellence. despite the issues i have highlighted at  like length above there is therefore a great deal to enjoy in this production but it is necessary to see it twice to get its full measure and to the companys credit entrance a second time is half price. if you are unable to do so and can only attend once then i must recommend that you use the not2b stream of the audience. this is no reflection on the performances witnessed by the 2b group its simply that  without the prince is a much better play as a play than is nothing but the prince. not2b is also recommended for those with weak knees. practical matters the wearing of sandals is ill advised and if you wish to join the 2b stream decent walking shoes are strongly recommended. and while the company does offer insect repellent it is advisable to lather yourself therein before attending yourself or possibly simply to bathe in it as the combination of a wet spring and the near total extinction of bats in the province leaves the final scene at grave risk of being further cluttered by the bodies of audience members exsanguinated by mosquitoes.,4,Tragedy,Positive
Hamlet,Classical Theatre Company's Hamlet Soars Under Careful Direction,Cynthia Greenwood,although the classical theatre company official motto promises to boldly re envision classical drama the five year old troupe believes it is important to show respect for a time honored script like s . and even though youtube ads thematically connect the show with the current surveillance scandal involving the united states government and edward snowden the company pays scant attention to that theme thankfully during a performance at the barnevelder arts complex. instead executive artistic director  ston and his resident company take a traditional approach to their sixth season opener and it serves them well. theatre veterans often speak of the challenges inherent in staging . over the centuries so many of the plays lines have entered our colloquial speech. echoes of this dramas most famous soliloquies have become hardened into proverbs or clichés making the job of producers that much harder. this iconic tragedy also forces directors and artists to grapple with questions involving s real or feigned madness how  truly feels about  whether or not  may have suspected or actually knew that  murdered her first husband and s possible motives for murdering his brother to name a few. effectively addressing the works ambiguities and complex theatricality requires that directors have a deep understanding of how the play operates. it was obvious from the companys most recent performance that ston knows his . as director he displays a thoughtful command of the plays myriad tensions and layers of irony. this understanding becomes most evident through his novel approach to set pieces that often sink under the weight of an audiences yearning for something original. in the first act when  dishes out fatherly advice to  both he and  unexpectedly chime in as he utters the well worn precept neither a borrower nor a lender be thereby instantly erasing the hackneyed quality of that scene. when  ventures inside the church with the intent to murder  as he prays the scene achieves an other worldly quality. playing  actor rutherford cravens appears far below the audiences eye level his countenance aglow in an ethereal light enveloped by darkness. the kings expressions of remorse uttered while his face is shrouded in light create an uncommon effect that tempers the viewers judgment of his crime. the blocking and lighting in this scene reflect some very clever directing and acting. such unique staging ensures that the scene becomes more about s inner conflict and less about s vacillation and the slow pace of his revenge plot. other set pieces in this show prove to be similarly well choreographed and performed apparently demonstrating the artists deep understanding of the comedy and quips that are woven throughout this script. for example in the role of the first clown actor ted doolittle joins matthew keenan as  to perform the famous gravediggers scene with precise timing and hilarious punning. dublin born keenan envisions the troubled prince as an impatient indignant figure given to rapid fire outbursts especially when he dons his antic disposition before  his parents and the feckless  and . keenan brings refreshing emotion and nuance to s most familiar speeches but his scenes with  and  tend to sound rushed and thereby less inspiring. the deficiencies of the spaces soundproofing occasionally conspire against the protagonist especially in the last act. at one point the traffic noise wrecks s reverent musings to  including keenans quiet assertion that there is a special providence in the fall of the sparrow. cravens a seasoned an who is adept at playing tragic and comic roles on houston stages year round envisions  as a commanding pragmatic ruler rather than a grasping ambitious usurper of his brothers throne. he imbues the role of the king with subtlety and consistency. in the role of  christianne mays deftly creates a palpable emotional distance between herself and . this distance seems barely perceptible until after  drowns when the queen silently repels the kings attempted embrace. actor ralph ehntholt is well cast as a fatherly and politically astute . joanna hubbard is equally well chosen as a youthful  obedient and deferential toward  while demurring before  during the plays first half. her wide eyed tear soaked countenance during expressions of madness are compelling after s murder even though her excessive pacing back and forth on stage seems a bit distracting. playing  dain geist is absorbing during the characters moments of extreme pathos but during outbursts of rage his lines are hard to follow. jarred tetteys portrayal of  is solid particularly in the culminating scene when  dies in his arms uttering some of the most poignant verse ever played for western audiences. as  and  who are recruited by  to spy on the prince jeff mcmorrough and amy garner buchanan exhibit able understatement and excellent timing.  rarely gets performed in houston so audiences seem eager to see it when it does get staged. this past season directors here have tackled other  plays such as henry v at main street theater and  at stark naked theater. it is clear that the original direction and artistic insights of this  though occasionally marred by the deficiencies of classical theatre companys new performance space are the work of a mature company that is quite capable of rivaling the best efforts of houstons well established troupes. the classical theatre company will perform  s  wednesday through saturday evenings at 800 pm. and on sundays at 230 p.m. through september 29 2013 at the barnevelder arts complex 2201 preston st. houston texas.,4,Tragedy,Positive
Hamlet,Hamlet is Maddening,Diana Louise Carter, just what is s problem anyway? thats the question raised in buffalo ny by  in delaware parks stylish production of . sure his father died. and his mother got remarried   to his uncle    all too quickly. st. louis actor shaun sheley returns to his native western new york to take on the title role of the play portraying the prince as maddeningly changeable perhaps even bipolar. but besides grief the underlying reasons for s continuing indecision and misery never quite emerge in this production directed by saul elkin sdps founder and artistic director. the current production done in beautiful elizabethan period dress against an elegantly stark black set is actually elkins fifth time around the danish block. perhaps because previous versions have been more avante garde there was a rock band on stage in one this one errs on the side of being too subtle.  things happen soliloquies fly by but the why of it all seems to be missing. sheley is best in the scenes with his unclestepfather  played by sdp veteran timothy newell. they almost seem like cat and mouse with a deliciously arrogant  holding the upper hand in the first part of the play and  seizing it later. on the other hand theres little chemistry between sheley and rebecca elkin young as .  during the play within a play scene they bicker like annoyed siblings rather than on again off again lovers. elkin young plays  as a young woman with a backbone before she descends into her own heart breaking madness. newells portrayal of  is multi layered and delicious. the actor clearly relishes the villain in  but he and  lisa vitrano also revel in their lust for one another. and newell is masterful in the way he waits a beat in delivering lines to show that he cannot be bothered to tell  and  apart or recall the name of s university. after his fratricide is unmasked in s little play newell does a great job showing s insecurity behind his usual arrogance. costume designer ken shaw seems to have had fun with the elizabethan fashions giving  a dress in the early part of the play with sleeves so voluminous that it looks as if she might be able to take flight.  s all black attire suits him as the somber figure. and s various dresses are simply elegant. the two story set designed by karen tashjian is a good match for  with the backdrops entirely painted an austere black interrupted only by two tapestry like banners painted with a street scene and a giant portrait of a lady. additional royal bits of color are added and taken away throughout the play in the form of a bright red closet curtain stools and chairs. the ghost of king  richard hummert arrives by stepping out from behind a black scrim painted with a giant gauzy image of his face. and his appearance is announced by suspenseful music sound and music by tom makar that invites the hairs on the back of your neck to stand up. another suspenseful moment comes during the duel between   rath and    just about the best swordplay i have ever seen on stage or screen. the rollicking duel features pointed weapons swooshing ever so close to both the swordsmen and the other characters nearby. if only the character of  could be as pointed and decisive ,3,Tragedy,Negative
Hamlet,"Hamlecchino, Clown Prince of Denmark",Eric Minton,with hamlecchino clown prince of den faction of fools is not necessarily doing something new with s most famous play rather they are attempting to make the play even older than it is. this theater company specializes in commedia dellarte the renaissance italian theatrical form with players wearing caricaturish masks performing comically stylized stock characters. it became popular in london by the 1560s and much evidence suggests it influenced . faction of fools demonstrated how in its hugely successful a commedia  and  earlier this year.  however is a stretch far beyond the bounds the company knew it was oerleaping when it decided to tackle this play. in his directors notes matthew r. wilson who also plays  demonstrates how s characters track with commedia stock characters the put upon patriarch the ghost the randy wife  the charismatic interloper  the babbling advisor  the young lovers  and  and the clever servant who schemes out the plot to set all right . commedia conventions include stylized movements and postures extracurricular slapstick acrobatics and acknowledging the audience billy finn as  even consults with one of the audiences sign language interpreters during his attempt at prayer soliloquy. the players also wear masks and aaron cromies creations are so detailed s even has a mole on it they seem genuinely expressive. still even if elements of commedia crept into s play  is something of an art form in and of itself. it can only be categorized as an and no matter what form this play is translated to the result will always be something less than the two versions of the   gave us. this is not however to denigrate hamlecchino anymore than saying it is not really . not only is it great theater in its own right  purists would do well to put aside their prejudice against non traditional stagings and check out this production for it offers many insights into the characters and their lines. they will also see a truly great  in wilson. wilsons expertise in commedia dell arte is unquestionable he has even taught the form in italy. with this performance of  he reveals himself to be an expert in an verse too. marrying his commedia choreography and comic emphasis to his verse speaking abilities and an sensibilities wilson plays the soliloquies in particular with wholly fresh takes on lines we all know so well. ironically though wearing a mask and overemphasizing gestures and inflection wilson demonstrates s soliloquies to be craftily written trains of thought that wend their own way and sometimes jump tracks i.e. s genius in genuinely portraying meditation. wilson also removes the conundrum of the rogue and peasant slave soliloquy by excising any notion that  had already settled on the play as the thing to catch the conscience of the king. with the idea as obvious as the nose on his mask wilson turns the fie upont foh about my brain line into an extended psychological comic interaction with the audience. catering to commedia conventions means altering points in the plot. the climactic fencing bout is played entirely for laughs and while the clever choreography of  and   v. bellomo exchanging rapiers is inspired hilarity it results in a wholly unan comic demise for .  death is also played entirely for laughs with subsequent slapstick remorse for  so dont look for a great psychological watershed moment in s evolution. the players become one player but that one player david gaines uses a clever succession of primitive masks to portray different parts and rather than speaking the priam and hecuba speech he mimes it replacing s great moment of pathos with gainess brilliantly funny dumb show.  is played by rachel spicknall as a woman who has a crush on  which alters the shadings of the prince commoner relationship  wrote into their scenes. the most notable alteration comes about through a play long gag inspired by casting gallaudet university students amelia hensley and nna devenow as  and  respectively. s journey to england is totally dropped so  and  do not end up dead. instead the famous line about their demise becomes a groaner of a pun. their use of american sign language also becomes a comic set piece  their old friend signs fluid asl but the clueless king and queen translate their conversations into sexually suggestive gestures and   mulford uses what can best be described as pidgin asl in his description of  as mad that is the productions funniest moment mutually appreciated by hearing and hearing impaired audience members alike. mostly though the production mines the comedy already rife in s original text we just do not always see the breadth and depth of that comic vein in other productions. even the ghost proves inherently funny. gainess ghost alternates his voice between an otherworldly specter  my hour is almost come when i to sulphurous and tormenting flames must render up myself and that of an impatient grandpa grown cynical pity me not but lend thy serious hearing to what i shall unfold. kudos to this production too for using multiple actors playing the ghost to create the tis here tis here sequence in the opening scene. the ghost also waggles his hand when describing his most seeming virtuous queen and as we had already met this sex addicted woman played by eva wilhelm we understand the ghosts meaning. in the closet scene when  compares the pictures of his dead father and uncle gainess ghost and finns  themselves play those pictures. for all the comedy gleaned from this tragedy and s seeming something closer to george carlin doing a stand up routine than the melancholy dane speaking a soliloquy wilson in both his playing and direction is ever respectful of s poetry. as wilhelms  solemnly recounts s death emma crane jaster playing  performs an aerial ballet sheathed in water emulating fabric that is as visually powerful as the spoken speech. jaster also uses her acrobatic skills and beautiful singing voice to great effect in the mad scenes plucking and presenting invisible flowers with her feet. is the audiences collective gasp in reaction to the humor portrayed there  agony or jasters skill? it is for all three at once. after the levity of the final scene the production ends with a visual image emphasizing that for all its fun this really is the tragedy of  prince of den. no it is not s  per se. it is hamlecchino clown a commedia dell arte version of s version of an ancient story that the bard composed at the height of his creative and story telling powers. the genius of this production is clearly inherited from its progenitor.,4,Tragedy,Positive
Hamlet,"Hamlet in Round Rock, Texas ",Michael Meigs,why climb a mountain? because its there. the small hard working group of friends at the sam bass community theatre in the town of round rock just north of austin know their public and regularly serve up dramatic fare thats been tested and approved in the community kitchens across the country. those futrelle sisters of the mythical small town of fayro texas imagined in the farces by the trio of hope jones and wooten for example or other kinder and more thoughtful staples of middle class dramatic life. the company does a good job on their tiny stage and the familiar faces satisfy and console. about once a year they stretch. not a little but a lot. in 2008 with  and  and in 2010 with waiting for godot samuel becketts mid 20th century existentialist masterpiece. in 2011 with frank benges magical steam punk tempest project memorably designed by kevin scholtes. this year director lynn beaver takes on the mt. everest of english language theatre the story of the much wronged and much haunted prince of a den that never really existed except in imagination. in the compiled version that has come down to us  is s longest text more than 4000 lines of unforgettable verse that takes more than four hours to perform entire. just about everyone knows the story. the language expressions and imagery live deep in the shared culture. beavers version at the sam bass plays start to finish in two hours including an intermission. key scenes are there but in order to achieve that concision the text has been amputated again and again. those who know it only vaguely wont be disturbed for the story remains as strong as ever but devotees of s language may experience the gaps as disconcerting. this text begins in the throne room with i ii where frank benge as  dominates with the mien and presence of a man mountain. he and susan poe dickson as  pronounce s lines for the royal couple with a grace scansion and spontaneity that ennobles both them and the verse. they achieve here and throughout the text a level of mimesis that demonstrates deep understanding of text and character. kevin scholtess  is a puzzle. he has his lines down pat but he delivers them in rushed contemporary prose. in a play that at its heart is about uncertainties and indecision this  has the bounce of a marvel comics hero. no inky cloak for him and never the slightest touch of black either costume designer veronica prior has given him a luscious set of edwardian threads in tans and creams including a voluptuous silk waistcoat.  reid as the ghost of s father appears as a shimmering white apparition back projected live on the curtain deep stage cente. its a fine effect.  bain and greg garcia as  and  give us a good account of those well meaning comrades as does justin elliot as . company regular gene storie is a predictable old duffer of a  stressing self important foolishness. though ken ramseys role as the gravedigger clown has been greatly reduced he does an affable job of it. as  dyan green is watchful disappointed both by her father  and by that smooth talking rascal . she is vulnerable and appealing qualities that show most strongly in the mousetrap scene and in the mad scene. s verse flows sweetly from her lips. returning to the opening question what exactly is ? why do ? ut philosophy professor paul woodruff in his 2008 book the necessity of theatre from oxford university press begins his treatise with a similar question pushing it to absurdity by positing a  put on by middle school children one thats modernized altered and performed in somewhat haphazard fashion. hes seeking to identify the essential elements of theatre. after eleven pages of entertaining discussion woodruff posits that  the theatre piece consists of four essential elements. summarizing these the player performs in a measured time and place. this makes the event a theatre piece. although the tradition of  has been broken repaired invented the performance is causally linked to s production of the play.  must show someone who is in a certain situation that calls for choice a plot the player must take action on the basis of choices shown on stage.  must be performed as a character and must be granted a certain kind of attention from the audience indicating its willingness to see the actor as the character in the full sense. the sam bass production meets and indisputably far surpasses those admittedly indulgent criteria. this evening at the old railroad depot on lee street however short is certainly  and its an effective gripping presentation of the great archetypical drama. the question that interests me more is the other one why does a community theatre do ? with limited resources available talent and a community audience they cannot hope to equal the great performances many of which are available on film. certainly theres a laudable teaching aim the desire to acquaint their audience and supporters with this enduring piece of dramatic art. but thats not everything and i think that its probably not the essential motivation. doing  doing  doing  and  doing waiting for godot    these are immensely rewarding experiences for an acting company. assimilating oneself with these characters with their plights their struggles and their emotions can become transcendent. there comes a time late in rehearsal and then in performance when the company enters that sacred space. and then ducdame ducdame by a pricking of our thumbs something wonderful this way comes. the sam bass company is in that magic circle thursdays through sundays through march 3.,3,Tragedy,Negative
Hamlet,Bad Hamlet Surprisingly Not Bad,Barry Eitel,when a young theatre company chooses a  play for their season the implicit message is usually hey we cant pay for rights and we need something with name recognition please dont expect too much out of us because were young and this classical stuff is really hard. design elements are cheap or nonexistent and the acting is usually passionate but incomprehensible. unless the play is a dear friend you usually leave the tiny sorry intimate black box space two hours older and more confused than when you entered. so experience would tell me do it lives current production of  is a travesty considering all of the factors. not only is the company of sfsu alums new to the scene theyve selected one of the most powerful and difficult plays as well as arguably the crowning achievement of western literature ever written. not only are they attempting  they are working from the infamous 1603 bad quarto where to be or not to be is not a question but rather the point. on top of all this the set consists of a bare stage three chairs a costume rack and two small wooden boxes. in the hands of many young directors this would be a recipe for disaster. however director jeremy forbing manages to craft a night of theatre that is clear engaging and thoroughly entertaining. the real title of the show is bad . do it live focuses on the bootleg quality of this much maligned copy probably hobbled together from the brains of some bribed actors. this pirated copy hit the streets a year before the more recognizable version was published in 1604. the characters we know as   and  are named corambis ncraft and gilderstone in this copy and many of the famous lines occur here as bizarre paraphrases. scholars of the past thought that the differences between the 1603 quarto and later good versions were the result of faulty memories of actors who played minor roles in s premier production. modern academia has reexamined the quarto and found that it might not just be a us facsimile of one of the best plays of all time. many of the irregularities still ring as an. this shorter more concise version of  could easily be a first draft or even a touring revision for productions outside of the big city. so it seems like this bastard quarto is at least s bastard. for do it live the decision to do the bad quarto makes some sense. its shorter fewer actors are needed and the basic plot stays the same. plus the different styling of much of the dialogue allows for some new insight into this well worn play. however the actual reason for choosing this version over others is not made very clear in the production. bad  is not essentially that different from normal good? . besides providing a few laughs i giggled anytime someone mentioned ncraft and gilderstone this version doesnt thrust the play in an entirely new light as much as i think the company wants it to. regardless this is a very fine if stripped down production of a magnificent play. perhaps the most obvious task for the actors in a an tragedy but also one of the most difficult yet most essential for a successful production is reciting the bards lines in a way that makes intellectual and visceral sense for an audience. without this not only are the characters unconvincing but the entire show quickly becomes a muddy quagmire of fancy language. do it live avoids this issue with aplomb. the entire cast understands and transmits this play. they are clear concise and effective. if you were completely unfamiliar with  youd leave the theatre knowing the story. simple as that sounds on paper that is a monumental achievement for any company especially one with a budget under a million dollars. sean owenss corambis is great injecting much needed humor into this bleak scenario. rik lopes gives a passionate performance as  and tamara leigh miller is icy as queen gertred. ben landmesser switches between leartes and  but is still able to pull off the most nuanced performance in the production. shay wisniewskis ofelia is a weak spot seeming more cardboard compared to the livelier performances. kenny tolls  carries the show but there are several times he obviously revels in the characters complexity as opposed to pushing the show forward. he therefore reads as occasionally false like when he turns over two chairs during the first lines of his opening speech. these missteps never drag down the show too far though. neither do several ill advised choices by forbing including making one minor role a surfer dude and focusing a lot of attention on a costume rack that is rarely used. the modern costumes stark set and uncolored lighting design are simple utilitarian and effective. the title bad  thankfully doesnt describe this productions quality. the show proves do it live has the talent and ability to do . more than that they can even do  well.,4,Tragedy,Positive
Hamlet,"Helen Merino's Cerebral, Androgynous Hamlet in Austin",Michael Meigs,the question that must be addressed when discussing this  staged by austin  is not why cast helen merino for the title role? but rather what does casting helen merino as  do to the play? merino played  ten years ago for the same organization then known as the austin  festival at free performances in zilker park downtown. she was an austin favorite at that time a 2001 article in the weekly austin chronicle identified her as one of the 40 most valuable players on austin stages. merino returned to austin to play the title role in schillers mary stuart in february 2010 and won a b. iden payne award for it the highest recognition voted by members of the austin theatre community. so we know that shes a pro and the prospect of seeing her in  is a draw. but what happens to the play? director ann ciccolella crafts a vigorous professional production as always with highly talented actors many of whom weve seen before in austin  productions. she gives merino the straightforward task of portraying a man a prince a would be sovereign haunted by the questionable ghost of his father represented here with the ingenuity of puppetry as a 15 foot tall spectre with a voice like that of darth vader. the puppetry is credited to gary jaffe. merinos  is androgynous cerebral and dismissive.  had it right when he warned his daughter  lord  is a prince out of thy star ii ii. this  has neither the brawn of a man nor the affect of a woman heshe reminds me strongly of a daughter of french landed aristocrats whom i once had the odd chance to meet. there was not a silver spoon in that mouth but rather a whole set of gleaming silver tableware. like that very foreign person merino as  has a self assurance born of privilege and a self absorption quite incomprehensible to ordinary mortals. theres little heart in this  and indeed  was the more deceived by any professions of affection. merino cuts off and insults  and  who are visibly surprised and offended.  has an uncommon command of language almost an aspergian brilliance remember the near perfect recitation of aeneas tale to dido not acted more than once as well as the aspergian difficulties in social interaction. we are conditioned by long exposure to this play to love  for the complexity and depth of his language and thought and it is only gradually during the three hours of this action that we may begin to lose our sympathy for this cold self reproaching child of privilege. the questions of age masculinity and maturity come starkly into focus in s relationship with . michael dalmon in that role is wiry intelligent masculine and open in his affections in fact demonstrating just the maturity that this  lacks. we do not know why  remains in s affections while the prince dispatches his duped good friends  and  to sudden death no shriving allowed.  gives no explanation other than perhaps s philosophy and this staging does not elaborate upon that. scott shipman plays  as a swishy fool which is most unfortunate. the rest of the cast reacts to the character accordingly. in my view acknowledged to be that of a former diplomat  may be sententious but he is acknowledged to be a statesman of long date who advised king  as well as . as happens very often the director and cast take s gibes as gospel and turn the character into comic relief. his death gains in meaning if one understands that he is a man of worth and consequence. the time period is undefined and pam fletcher fridays costumes are a mixture of edwardian and early victorian dress. s white gathered gown resembles something out of the illustrations of dante gabriel rosettei. philip kreyche as rebellious  comes onstage carrying a carbine. standing out among a very accomplished cast is barry pineo actor teacher and theatre reviewer for the austin chronicle as the player king and the gravedigger the first with attentive dignity and the second with a roustabout humor. the director would have done well to enlist him for act v as one of the ambassadors from england it was disconcerting to see steve cruz a doughty  return to announce his own death. and while im nit picking concerning the grave itself a commodious opening in the center stage platform why didnt the players lower  into that tomb rather than leaving her bier front and center where chelsea duvall was clearly visible scrambling off stage after the lights had faded on v i? the finale is swift and dramatic with the complex clash of foils choreographed by fight coordinator  minor. the ending is memorable with s final gasp the rest is silence and a distraught  clasping the dead prince. austin s  is a riveting evening despite the questions and issues that this staging raises. it plays its final weekend at the rollins black box theatre at the long center from friday october 7 through sunday october 9. midway through the run the company posted at youtube.com a vivid video montage of performance scenes. unfortunately they are mute the two and a half minute presentation plays over a heavy sound track resembling that of a warner brothers costume epic.,4,Tragedy,Positive
Hamlet,Minimalist Hamlet shows less is more,Craig Melson,i will happily challenge anyone who doesnt believe that  is in the top three most performed  plays and probably number one.there have been so many productions in recent times that the challenge is how to make your version stand out. the rsc did this by getting doctor who david tennant to play  and disney even tried doing  with lions. so when a small but well reputed theatre company in south east london try to do a play thats been done so many times how do they keep it fresh? the galleon theatre company opts to cut the play down to two hours and for the most part director bruce jamieson who also played  makes it work. he keeps the famous and vital scenes intact whilst cutting out many altogether. this fast tempo creates a real sense of urgency among the characters though some tedious scenes such as the players going on about priam are left intact. robin holden whose impressive ever changing portrayal of  occupies the title role. too often those who play  only use one mode for the role ranging from boy going mad delicate schemer angry teenager to angst driven hormonal whine bag. what holden does well is appreciate the princes varying emotional states and he applies different styles magnificently throughout the play. these swings in styles and moods add to the urgency and introduce some unpredictability to a very familiar play. the rest of the roles are played very conventionally most likely because of the reduced script. given it is a two hour performance no other character is afforded anywhere near the same stage time as  so there is not enough time to explore some of the plays nuances such as s turmoil or  quite rage though the whole oedipus thing came through in spades. jamieson plays  magnificently with a sense of entitlement and rough demeanour though it could not have hurt to have more of  who is played as very submissive by jane stanton. a good by product of this reduced performance is that some characters lost importance allowing jamieson and the actors a real chance to have fun with them. the gravediggers are brilliant as are the matching butler attire  and  who are played with a real tweedledum and tweedledee element. what doesnt work? eleanor wodowskis costumes for a start are a mismatch with nineteenth and early twentieth century clothes clashing with much older garb indeed the grave diggers are styled like pirates of the caribbean extras whilst the players look ridiculous. some decisions like silently re enacting cut out scenes on top of monologues are bizarre as is the emptiness of the stage russell fisher is credited with set and scene design. the greenwich playhouse would describe itself as intimate and even though the space is very well used by the actors it couldnt have hurt to have more than one bench as stage decoration. i did feel sorry for the brilliant elana martin  who ended up on the floor too many times for what i believe was a lack of options for places to sulk. the only other niggle is the climax which is acted out far too quickly. however these are minor and the staging in general is excellent accompanied by superb lighting design by robert gooch. the ghost is well lit and lighting such a small stage created some amazing if unintentional shadows. the sword fight is good value as is the subtle use of sound. jamieson and producer alice de sousa have put together a great show. the fact its over in two hours makes the show accessible and jamieson has been careful not to compromise the story or leave any major plot points out. purists may be shocked by some omissions but all the key aspects are there and the small stage and gripping performances prove in this case at least that less is more.,4,Tragedy,Positive
Hamlet,Japhy's Unweeded Garden: Hamlet in Austin,Michael Meigs, in the brainy university town of austin capital of the state of texas many will argue in favor of a favorite song or play but few other than the freshmen at the vast downtown ut campus will insist on their choice of the ultimate movie or band or work of art.    is the best writer death cab for cutie is the most sublime band ever  dostoevsky has captured the true infirmity of the human soulthose absolutes fade as one ages reads more and experiences more.  our favorite  plays are measure for measure and coriolanus but nonetheless  is probably the best of s plays.your ardent freshman university student might argue that  has the best lead role the most emphatic villain the saddest heroine and comic foils everywhere.  the plot is tight and moves between the supernatural and political themes with a seamlessness emulated in everything from brave new world to star wars. its ending is tragic beyond tragedy and its message as meaningful as it is morose. if a theatre company were to choose one work as their flagship production then they could do no better than this s magnum opus.others could riposte that the play is sprawling complex and behooving of a certain reverence  one should not be approach it lightly.  this solemn viewpoint was evident in the  of justin scalise produced here last year initially at the

in a country barn starring the talented yale law student daniel friedman austins city theatre did  with aaron black in 2009 and austin  stages it later this month with the actress helen merino in the title role.but no one does  as often or as reably as japhy fernandes and the austin drama club.  theyve just mounted their sixth production since 2004.  unlike previous editions staged in a clandestine home theatre eventually shut down by the city of austin this one took place twice nightly over two weekends at the shabbily reputable off center in east austin.fernandess most recent vision of the bards classic is on a different level nay on a different planet from the plays traditional interpretation and this is by all means refreshing.  the company has crafted a version that highlights the eight main characters and their stories.  all minor characters and sub plots have been completely excised and some lines have been reassigned. in this production  is the one who barks that something is rotten in den.but these characters are far from den.rob novak is  japhy fernandes is  and ellen fernandes is . in their signature guerrilla theatre fashion the adc company uses lots of curtains a few paintings and a makeshift garage style bar and cabaret to transform the black box of the off center into a place without country or time.  the low light and constant ambient background noise complete the illusion and create a setting straight out of science fiction.  we see vestiges of various eras foils chalices record players cell phones whiskey bottles and modern art blend together.  the ghostly low lighting and the intermittent wisps from a smoke machine give the viewer the feeling of peeking into the characters minds rather than spying on them in their castle.that is the nub of it the actors incarnating the eight main characters display their own particular interpretations of neuroses and psychoses. the effect of this is largely comic. s descent into madness is usually portrayed as a young woman shouting and bleating nursery rhymes and love songs to an onstage audience frozen in their inability to understand or help. in this production elena weinbergs  literally sings her blues to the accompaniment of a thumping bass and wailing guitar. there is little sadness and much strangeness in this approach but it remains true to the characters self alienation and descent into vulnerability. rob novak as  still cries frailty thy name is woman in reference to his mother yet ellen fernandes interpretation of queen  is anything but weak.  closer in temperament to s queen fernandes gerturde is icy cold vigilant and impossible to distract.  she kills to protect what she has. this  makes one wonder whose idea it was to kill s father in the first place.at a certain point one of the curtain walls collapses smoke pours out and larry oubre as the ghost of s father steps out and sings a harrowing rendition of vesti la giubba put on the costume from leoncavallos 1892 opera pagliacci. the piece fits the plays mood builds the tension and offers a nice musical relief from the plays dramatic action.  fittingly this aria concerns a man who has just discovered his wifes infidelity.austin drama clubs sixth production of  is not only a look at the characters individual mental breakdowns but also a nod at the groups own journey.  during the play within a play scene the actors gather around a television to watch a video recording of the play within a play made by their own company several years previously. the post modern maneuver  acknowledges that the themes of  remain timeless and suggests that the theatrical desire to re explore them will never end.    co authored with brian paul scipione,3,Tragedy,Negative
Hamlet,"Despite Heat Wave, PSF Rolls Out Wicked Cool Hamlet",Jennifer Kramer,it is a tribute to the strength of the production that despite the audience members braving a heat index of 115ºf to view the pennsylvania  festivals opening performance of  when the first scene begins with a hapless guard huddling against the cold on the frigid battlements of elsinore one nevertheless experiences a few sympathetic shivers. in addition to conquering the weather director patrick mulcahy and cast successfully assail the ponderous theatrical history of s most famous play and offer a spirited rendition that is definitely their own. justin s stars as the title character perhaps a little slow to start he nevertheless hits his stride after the first act and produces a sympathetic  fully capable of carrying the play. his performance is energetic even hyperactive but never manic except for purposes of deception a dynamic mirrored by the cast and production in general. two performances in particular both embody this high energy dynamic and offer notable interpretations of their roles. the first is greg wood as  who plays the king as a bluff jovial and charismatic leader content to leave his sinister past behind   until  blows his cover. then he becomes a desperate yet quick thinking schemer surprisingly sympathetic as a man able to seize his opportunities at the expense of his conscience. meanwhile mairin lees  is unsurprisingly sympathetic but unexpectedly steely a passionate young woman capable of rough housing with her brother and standing up to him when he tries to interfere with her love life or giving  the cold shoulder at the play after their disastrous break up. only her father can make her feel shame and doubt her love and this conflict between authority and self confidence leads to her eventual breakdown. when her father is killed she loses her wits but not her force of personality there is no authority figure now who can stop her from singing stripping or tugging her symbolic rolling chair of loss unless she wants to. the strong supporting performances of  and  draw out their parallels with  as well as exploring the complexity of s characters. less satisfying is the costume design though in the technical sense designer sam flemings products are beautiful and well executed or not as required the players worn stage finery was a thoughtful touch. presumably to acknowledge the cast performing  in rep with pride and prejudice the design is clearly inspired by a 19th century aesthetic though the end result is more a haphazard display of the greatest hits of 1800s fashion than a concentrated effort to evoke a particular time period. the decision to dress everyone in black supports the plays insistence that the royal wedding followed the royal funeral with unseemly haste however this does make it decidedly odd that  would then urge  to cast off his nighted color when no one else has herself included. in contrast the set design is simple yet effective the only permanent installation is the two story parallelogram of cell like bars doubling as sliding doors and a projection screen. further elaboration for the scenes is provided by set dressing descending from the ceiling red wall runners and chandeliers for the throne room a white arras for s closet and wheeled furniture. the latter is beautifully suited for such a lively cast immediately establishing  and  happy siblinghood as they zoom onto the stage on their couch whooping with joy tracking s put on insanity and genuine disruptiveness as he abuses and rearranges everyones seats and beds at his will or providing a tragic callback as  reappears after her breakdown tugging s rolling desk chair like a childs wagon and addressing the empty seat in her fathers stead. the set is clearly designed to be interacted with and tracking the characters who do and do not take advantage of this suggests yet another level of complexity to the actors performances. director patrick mulcahy does an excellent job balancing not only his cast but the text as well. in addition to drawing strong performances from his actors he makes clever use of double casting to add metacommentary to their roles christopher coucill as the ghost and the player king and wayne s. turney as  and the grave digger are both particularly of note. judicious editing allows mulcahy to tweak the characters arcs to augment their actors portrayals while retaining moments that are less plot relevant but more thematically important to this particular production. less thematically important material is ejected the exclusion of  appearance at the end underlines the productions emphasis on the clash of personalities not political forces. there are a few missteps however. while a large projection of the moon is atmospheric confusion over calculating its phases only aggravates the plays already obscure timeline. meanwhile the music mainly romantic string quartets between scene breaks usually strengthens the mood or setting but occasionally serves only as a distraction an enraged  storming in on  gun drawn does not really need to be heralded by a scare chord. the fight choreography for the majority of the play is intense and realistic which makes it all the more jarring when  and  duel plays out more as competing auditions for an errol flynn swashbuckler than a bout between two fencing masters. overall however the individual touches added by mulcahy and the cast and the crew only increase their productions value   even the seemingly trivial ones. the mournful look on one players face as  informs the company that their role is to hold up a mirror to nature and she contemplates the gaudy mask in her hand speaks more eloquently about the nature of theater than whole reams of critical theory. details like this make the pennsylvania  festivals  a worthy comon to other productions as well as a memorable relief from the weather.,5,Tragedy,Positive
Hamlet,"More Matter, Less Art in Fast-Moving First Quarto Hamlet",Christopher Adams,i looked at the clock two hours and twenty minutes including the interval. productions of comedy of errors ran this length not . recently i sat through a nearly four hour elsinorian behemoth. but all the dramatic boxes had been ticked there was a ghost a sable suit an arras a jumped in grave multiple slaughters and so on. and yet there were no major cuts. as the saying goes just because everything has changed doesnt mean that anything is different. welcome to the alternative  universe compliments of the first published  text the 1603 quarto q1. this text has often been aspersed by scholars as a bad quarto since among other reasons it is considerably shorter than the second quarto and first folio versions. suppositions for why this is the case include that q1 was an acting text andor was reconstructed from memory by the actor playing  or both or neither. nevertheless q1 resembles the received  in shape if not in length or detail. watching vital signs theatres production of q1  at the white bear theatre club i was struck with the cognitive dissonance of listening to speech that resembled the familiar but contained unexpected changes and omissions. as director imogen bond says in the promotional material even people who are not over familiar with the canonical  may be unsettled when  says to be or not to be but then doesnt say that is the question. it is instead ay theres the point. unsettling indeed as are a whole host of other changes. but while some changes are questionable we must admit that ay theres the point is a bit of a let down others work well. when ofelia q1 changes some of the character names and spellings recounts s accosting her in the gallery her language is toned down the images sharper his shoes untied and the previously ridiculous situation becomes far more plausible. as an acting text q1 moves swiftly. the interval arrives after  says the plays the thing  where other productions cut off sometime around the   exchange. what does it do to our perception of the play when corambis aka  is not dead until well into the second half? a breath of fresh air is gertreds development. instead of simply reading s letter describing his aborted journey to england  discusses its contents with gertred. she thus becomes aware of her now husbands treachery against her son and this provides juicy subtext for further gertred king scenes. the ending too is swift. there is blissfully little pitter patter between leartes and the king just some curt plotting and getting on with it. bond gathers a plum cast and their strong training comes through in solid delivery. jamie matthewmans  makes clear work of his lines and creates an emotionally believable character. matthew spencers leartes demonstrates impressive range exhibiting finely masked rage upon his return to den.  katis artfully conceals and reveals gertreds horror upon learning her current husband has killed her first husband and is now trying to kill her son. katis directs the line a rat a rat at the king robert lonergan ostensibly relating the news of corambiss maurice byrne death but actually venting her disgust. in an interesting move bond casts  as a female played with intelligence and depth  by katie hayes. the vague 1930s setting allows for a clever song and dumb show routine during the play within the play. yet other choices are less successful and the production suffers from poorly defined relationships. for example  makes it clear to ofelia rebecca pownall that he never loved her so why is he jumping in her grave? also though the cast is large bond has pownall double as the second gravedigger forcing ofelias body to be represented by a black sheet during the funeral scene unnecessary in a production that otherwise tends toward the straightforward. q1  in performance is a rare treat providing a driven story while still maintaining emotional resonance. its different approach to key events in the play are refreshing after being  so conventionalized by centuries of performance history.,3,Tragedy,Negative
Hamlet,National's Hamlet is Fat and Scant of Breath,Christopher Adams,when it opened in october the nationals  received strong reviews with critics noting the taut energy and vision of nicholas hytners direction as well as rory kinnears well crafted performance. i had been eager to see the production managing to acquire a ticket for the second to last performance of the london run  goes on tour in february. but i was concerned since i wondered if this production which i knew to be critically acclaimed would still be so on the night in question. the evening did not begin auspiciously. i sat in the upper tier slightly left of center. designer vicki mortimers set is three sided one wall at the rear stage and two walls perpendicular like a box with one side and the top removed. which must be fantastic for the audience in the center stalls but it causes sight line problems for those of us on either side. the play begins suddenly but bernardo michael peavoy is barely audible his voice swallowed up by the vast olivier. at which point the mid twenty something skinny jean and thick rimmed glasses wearing guy next to me decides it would be a brilliant idea to begin eating soup. in the middle of the performance. with a fork. disgusting. as the action moves to the interior of the castle the walls fold in on themselves lessening the severe angles.  patrick malahide delivers his opening speech as a television broadcast taking s clare higgins hand in a simpering gesture demonstrating that all is well in the state of den. or at least publicly. hytner populates elsinore with secret service agents secretaries and aides. no one is ever alone in this information state. den does feel like a prison and  becomes the observed of all observers.  confronts  ruth negga with spy photos of her and  in compromising positions. there is a bug in the bible  carries during her interview with . what of s opening line a little more than kin and less than kind? kinnear speaks with extreme clarity he has had a long time to ruminate on this part but at the expense of speed. with other  this would not be an issue. but this is . a brief program note reads a conflation of the second quarto and folio texts would run to more than 4000 lines or well over 4 hours  by far s longest play. about 500 lines have been cut from the text for this production. we have at least 3500 lines to get through and if kinnear is going to meticulously chew over every line before swallowing we will not finish dinner until it is past our bedtime. pace aside kinnear is gripping. slightly pudgy and balding but still with a gleam of youth he somehow seems more suitable than waifish or much older s. he reeks of perpetual student dom desperate to return to university so he can sit in cafés smoke and one senses continue his phd program that he has been in for the last seven years. this s wit and wordplay we learn comes from his mother as  morbidly laughs at s reference to the slain  as most grave. he draws a smiley face and writes the word villain under it referring to  and then has this design printed on t shirts and distributed to the play audience of the play within the play. i have seen to be or not to be done in many clever and inventive ways but rarely do i see it performed straight up without any gimmicks. kinnear only has a cigarette to wave about amid the murmur of people finishing the phrase that is the question. as he approaches tis a consummation devoutly to be wished i hear the crisp gunshot of a page turning in the audience someone is following along. the most iconic speech of the most iconic british playwright delivered straightforwardly if slowly with clarity a ballsy choice. the concept of den as a police state is executed brilliantly even shockingly. s suicide it is suggested was orchestrated possibly with the help of  as punishment for s alex lanipekun attempted revolution. collusion with violence even touches  as he shrugs off the death of   kingsley and  prasanna puwanarajah. and strong turns from kinnear and higgins create a solid center. but in the final duel scene a drunken  points to  and shouts hes fat and scant of breath and this is the perfect way to describe the end of the nationals  run. clocking in at three hours and forty six minutes suffering from too many pregnant pauses not only from kinnear but from the entire cast the performance feels like the flabby gone to seed version of a production that was once fresh and fit.,4,Tragedy,Positive
Hamlet,Hamlet Has No Legs,Melissa Crismon,this farcical world created by the all puppet players in their production of  has no legs is adulterated hilarity influenced by the muppet show and intermingled with improv.  nathan makaryk a large beaked bird and  shaun michael mcnamara a long faced man with glasses reminiscent of beaker inform the audience that much of the play has been cut out though the complete synopsis remains. this comic relief side show already has the audience in hysterics with belly laughing and high pitched squeals.  and  go on much like the judges did in the muppet show. perched in the balcony they say you wont hear phrases such as neither a borrower nor a lender be. the audience laughs as the puppets shake their heads and explain that in this economy it would be insensitive to leave that phrase in.  the show delivers more of the same until the bitter end when everyone dies. rather every puppet dies a melodramatic death. puppets add a new dimension to the costume category.  and  are behind props as expected but the rest of the puppets are seen with the actors. all the actors are suited up in what resembles black fencing gear. the curtains and floor are black so that the actors fade and the eyes follow the puppets. one hand controls the mouth and the other hand controls one of the puppets hands. danny montooth who plays an orangutan looking  is also the puppet trainer which must have been like herding cats or ninja kitties. ten guards are swapped out for ninja kitties made out of black gloves with glued on pink and white features.  as five actors file out making marching sounds they hold up their kitten gloves. one kitty has only one eye while another kitty has a tag left on. in the program next to nathan makaryks name it reads   bernardo  and combat choreographer. combat on stage makes for great theater but with puppets it is intriguing and us. what can you expect with combating puppets? ridiculously funny is what you can expect.  makaryk and  mcnamara warm up with plastic swords whipping them around. mcnamara gets the sword all spun up for a silly scuffle. as the play calls for a change of rapiers the second actors come in to control the second hand of the two puppets indicating drama while the sword is changed to a metal one for a battle matrix style. the cast also includes   rocky balboa  glenn freeze  kalinda gray player king evan green and lastly player queen rochelle pospisil at the maverick theater set in revitalized downtown fullerton across the street from the train depot surrounded by newer stucco row townhomes and businesses. enjoy this edgy and hilarious re visioning of  in a 48 seat theater and have a drink in an art deco style 48 seat cabaret.,5,Tragedy,Positive
Hamlet,"Hamlet in Austin—Taut, Swift and Gripping",Michael Meigs,those lustrous eyes that bony frame that complexion sicklied oer with the pale cast of thought many of us in austin texas believe that justin scalise was born to play . he has certainly trained for  and for this role in new orleans in england and for the past three years in austin. we have seen him as bottom     don   and lucio. and even  freeze dried for austin s 2008 and 2009 worlds fastest . this  directed by  matthews for the scottish rite theatre is a keen intelligent entertaining and gripping production. scalise has the principal role but this evening offers much more than just an outing for his fan club. the cast knows how to speak the speech. babs george as  harvey guion as  robert deike as a whole suite of ordinaries brock england as  chuck ney as  the verse comes trippingly on those tongues. its a thrill to hear it delivered articulately with convincing scansion and appropriate targeting and emotion. the action is swift but unerringly certain. there are moments when one would like to see a bubble of silence as a character reflects or absorbs the meaning of something just said. but anyone who has studied the play read it or seen any other version of  will follow the players all the way and will be on the edge of his seat. matthews has put them into contemporary costume but does not burden the play with unnecessary concept or gimmickry. no telephoning in performances no ak 47s no roller skates or cowboy hats. the familiar haunting action develops immediately before us in the intimacy of the scottish rite theatre using a minimum of portable furniture placed as needed before various of its intricate trompe loeuil 19th century painted backdrops. the striking appropriate music before the play is recorded. in this version the plays the thing. the company has tailored it so that several of them play multiple roles. for example deike becomes in turn  noting down s instructions about spying on  the head player with a theatric and assured delivery of the speech of troy priam and hecuba and a pragmatic indifferent gravedigger.  elects to send  off as the emissary to old norway giving me some momentary misgivings but trey deason comes back with the due good news even if he is wearing his foppish red hat. harvey guions  has the earnest urging cheerfulness of a salesman whos worried that his goods have begun to lose their attraction to the public. he thinks hes playing a middle game and even in his moment of dubious contrition this  doesnt appear really to believe he got it wrong. babs georges  is not complicit with him but is rather an impressively well dressed mother trying to hold the family together. her consternation at the confrontation with  is harrowing. chuck neys  is a dusty old duffer in a tweed jacket rather the droll stereotype of a university professor his role in real life as it happens david meissner rob novak in the theatre department at texas state department.  is no idiot even if at times he does ramble on. matthews put  and  into yobbo outfits and directed them so that they come across as fuzzy contemporary danish versions of lager louts. rg cannot match  in wit but one doubts that hed have had anything to do with such lowlifes in wittenberg. rob novak and david meissner at times seemed to have wandered over from the aggressively counterculture austin drama club where novak played his own  last december. i admired julia lorenz olsen. she chides her brother  patrick kaufmann with sisterly grace and whimsy. as events proceed we see her vulnerability her emotions are always visible despite her efforts to contain them. lorenz olsen is as ripe as a late season peach and her madness is apt in a universe where reverses and catastrophes overwhelm simplicity and openness. graceful comic moments relieve our tension as the tragedy is woven inexorably around us. soldier   minor starts guiltily at s rant on the ramparts against drunkenness.  and  share a smile and silently mime  familar advice. gravedigger deike neatly one ups the second gravedigger  minor again in a drinking exchange. theres some enigmatic business involving that cross on a chain around s neck which ends up in the hands of a bewildered  brock england. which brings us back to scalise and the overall experience of the matthewsscalise . my advice go. go twice. see what this focused well spoken taut player does with the character who has haunted him. they jointly inhabit a swift and moving performance. they portray for us us a perceptive energetic man of spirit appalled that the world can betray so much promise with such evil. if it be now then at the scottish rite theatre at 18th and lavaca downtown to october 3 if it be not now yet tis to come october 21 to november 7 in the confines of the boggy creek cemetery on circle s road in south austin. for the second run produced by black swan productions most of the players will be the same but ashley edwards will take the role of .,4,Tragedy,Positive
Hamlet,Hamlet Soars High at the Theatricum,Nairi Najarian, a funny thing happened on the way to the theatricum. the show starts before you even get there. let me explain this being my first venture out to the will geer theatricum botanicum located in the woods of the topanga canyon i make every effort imaginable to not get lost. i alternated glances at the calculated route on my phone the mapquest print on my lap and the occasional mercy glance at the road to reassure my companion that i wouldnt drive us off a cliff. the fifteen minute drive up into the clouds breeds this us excitement for what awaits you at the top. this method of transport to the world and players of the theatricum botanicum is a fun launch pad to the main event.  anoints the 2010 summer repertory season at the theatricum under the direction of artistic director ellen geer the daughter of veteran actor will geer. the history of this 299 seat amphitheatre is your classic hollywood fairytale come true. grandpa geer blacklisted from tinseltown during the mccarthy era wanted to stick it to the powers that be when he decided that an out of work actor is still an actor so he planted a theater sanctuary in the topanga woods and dubbed it the theatricum botanicum latin for theater in the garden. actors mike peebler and jeff wiesen both ucla theater alums alternate the roles of  and  throughout the season. peebler is tonights . no stranger to tb or the works of the bard peeblers  is virile and electric. this  is the  a beloved ucla professor used to describe as the man studying for his masters degree who comes home to find his uncle banging his mommy. hes too smart too angsty for his own good. he has no job because all he does is study speak in riddles stage sit ins and read zola. he mows you down with the way his eyes light up and the way his body permeates each emotion. he scares you and excites you. this is peeblers . the show gains momentum during the ghostly encounter in the final scene of act 1. old s ghost played by tim halligan is ominous in a silver cloak draped over his form as he drags himself across roofs and platforms only to disappear into the hillside a trail of obscured thunder ing each heavy step.  his loyal  stefan tabencki and their men set off into the hillside after the apparition. this is when one notices the grand scale of the worldly stage these actors use to make their performances more rich. they chase jump over levels and dig their heels deep in soft soil only to stomp across floorboards in the next scene. aaron hendry and melora marshall play  and  but come across as a substitute couple for nearly every celebrity pairing these days. a spouses expiration date nears they get kicked to the curb and the cougar jumps into bed with the younger man. hollywood loves their cougars and so does den it seems. marshall is striking as  and could put julie christies profile to shame as she claims her second wind with the brutish lothario that is hendrys . you almost cant blame these two for doing away with that other guy. hendry and marshall share a potent chemistry with caresses and kisses in every scene they share. they are also the most stylish on stage thanks to costume designer val miller with special acknowledgement to shon leblanc  valentinos. see? they have a stylist. carl palmer as the meddling sycophant  is bumbling and a bit scattered but perhaps this works for the character since the players about him are steadfast in contrast except for  of course. palmers performance is light and lacks the sinistry that many times accompanies the character of . he handles  played by willow geer more like a ragdoll than a daughter. furthermore peeblers delivery of his second soliloquy o what a rogue and peasant slave am i  is brilliant. the audience listens to every word every exhale and the moment peebler utters the last lines before his exit a lull takes over the crowd. perhaps we were struck dumb for a few seconds before we thought it a good idea to erupt into a cheering applause before the following scene but im willing to bet had peebler just performed his six soliloquies opening night the crowd would have left satisfied. he had us at hello. s impending madness is always the performance i watch out for. up until act 4 geers  is subdued almost reluctant to speak any words. her costume mirrors the headpiece of a nun but the bodice and smock closely resembling an anne boleyn portrait. there is an outward show of duality in her effects but s insides are hidden away until her final act. geer thrusts herself onto the stage in a white nightgown feet bare her strawberry blonde hair a shocking revelation. she sings and stutters and spits madness onto everyone in her path. her melody is sad but then again it is to be expected. geers performance is horrifying and heartbreaking as she spills to her knees and weeps for her lost father. she shrieks her words and pounds her chest so violently in a manner so disturbing it is nothing short of stunning. the barefoot geer even runs away into the forest with  on her tail. while the scene continues onstage all eyes are transfixed on the far corner of the hillside where the spotlight is bright enough to capture s strawberry blonde hair and white nightdress retreating into the darkness. the final act is fascinating because one is us to see how the re entry of wiesen as  plays against peeblers  if only to get hints of how the other could play the alternate character on a different night. the rapier match flows  for  probably because both peebler and wiesen are well versed in stage combat thanks to aaron hendrys electrifying fight direction. at the proverbial curtain the audience is reluctant to let peebler go. exhilarated i look around and wonder why this beautiful amphitheater with ample seating is not packed on opening night. the crowd was plentiful but still unacceptable. do not pass up an invitation to the theatricum botanicum on a summer night. bring a dear friend a blanket and a lovely spread. s  is cherished and protected here. this woodland haven truly is an actors playground. i suggest you go watch them play. remember to leave reality at the foot of the mountain and your head in the clouds.  ,5,Tragedy,Positive
Hamlet,Big Upset in a Hamlet for the Moment,Denise Battista,do you remember that scene from the movie big with tom hanks? the one where josh hanks sits in on a focus group about a new toy josh i dont get it. paul what exactly dont you get? josh it turns from a building into a robot right? paul precisely. josh well whats fun about that? paul well if you had read your industry breakdown you would see that our success in the action figure area has climbed from twenty seven percent to forty five percent in the last two years. there that might help. josh oh. paul yes? josh i still dont get it. i feel like bill rauch needs a focus group filled with people like josh.  is a big play.  is a big character. we all know the story to some degree and weve all heard the lines in common use whether we track them to  or not. i commend rauch for being bold. in 2008 he brought ancient sanskrit theatre to the stage as he directed audiences to the non western world of clay cart and in 2009 rauch took a huge risk when he adapted and directed osfs first full on musical music man. darn good show darn good time. great even. but his ? i dont get it. during my recent interview with this plays  dan donohue made the very real statement that in order to play the prince he must break the role up into its separate parts right now i only see the parts one moment at a time and if i think about it as a whole at this stage i feel consumed with fear because if i think ahead oh ive got that nunnery scene coming up  im like ohhhhhh dont think about that it has to be moment by moment by moment otherwise i sort of go mad  i get this and its a terrific way to do what  cant seem to do until the final act live and thus act in the present. but the production as a whole seems to rely on this technique and what we get is something that lacks cohesion. i dont think its dan donohues fault at least insofar as his acting ability rather it seems a matter to take up with the director or in this case directors as rauch claims this production is a 5050 directorial collaboration between him and donohue. in a production made up of moments we get the gamut of not good to very good. deborah m. drydens modern dress costume design is unreable while christopher acebos set design wows across the board acebo also designed the set for this seasons must see opener cat on a hot tin roof directed by christopher liam moore. the stage looks a bit askew awry if you will and filled with shadows and corners. hidden partitions extend from the backdrop during the play to create rooms and hiding places while surveillance cameras look on from above. the most telling piece of work in acebos set design is the wall standing stage left complete with bars and barbed wire to reinforce that this den is indeed a prison. a stone wall backdrop takes the audience inside and outside the walls of elsinore castle with christopher akerlinds seamless and at times haunting lighting design. i only wish rauch would have turned to akerlind instead of  cusicks overly techie and terribly distracting projections when representing a larger than life fade in and out of the ghost. in this case howie seago the actor who plays the ghostly  sr. would have made much more of an impact during his haunting than the flashy projections and fuzzy fade outs. aside from the techie stuff and the bizarre gi joe fatigues that weigh seago down in the beginning of the show casting seago as the ghost is genius. howie seago is deaf and in this production he speaks his words through his hands with donohue translating what is necessary along the way. this fatherson relationship is gripping intimate and introduces a level of understanding and closeness between these two s that trumps any production ive seen before stage or screen. and seagos ghost remains a powerful presence even when offstage with donohue grasping his memories with intermittent episodes of signing throughout the play. its apparent that this  is an isolated prince. the production begins before the proverbial curtain which is a theme this season as all the shows begin with some sort of action on the stage prior to the plays actual start. this offers a prologue of sorts with an added scene of what happens in s universe before s play begins. well done. but then we have to start defining things. the whos the whys and the whats. we get that s in mourning although donohue could easily liaison as a secret service agent in his current state of dress. but what about ? i found myself asking my own whos there? as  played by armando durán comes into the scene only recognizable by his lines. he seems more early 1970s vietnam veteran than wittenburg scholar and hes erratically physical cloudy and barely present enough to seem important. but in this production  is not the orator and for some reason he is not trusted to tell s story. i dont get it. jeffrey king as  is vulgar and pompous and doesnt even try to toss on a facade of care and kingship. he seems like a rich brat who had his glory days back in college and now he just drinks and has ski weekends and im not all too sure why but he attempts to murder  a couple of times perhaps the purpose lying in the gasps of audience reaction. maybe rauch just wants to make sure we absolutely despise  because the reasons  gives us murdering his brother marrying his brothers wife and attempting to murder  just dont cut the mustard. his own soliloquy is defeated by setting it in the bathroom kings final words spoken while sitting on the pot. okay his offense is rank. okay it smells to high heaven. must we be literal? i dont get it. greta oglesby plays the part of  and i mean that she absolutely plays the part. its apparent this is an actress playing a role and thus its just plain boring. the bedroom scene adds intrigue however but the purpose is left dangling in the wind of an idea. what are the implications of  actually seeing the ghost of her dead husband during this scene? its an interesting idea but rauch doesnt apply any effect to this cause. are we supposed to suppose  is a conspirator to her husbands murder? are we supposed to hate her too? i dont get it. what i do get is the touching and beautiful relationship between brother and sister team  and  played by david desantos and susannah flood respectively. they are playful and loving and youll get that each cares about the other a crucial aspect in this play if were to feel our heartstrings pull if not yank during s mad scene as in this production the  love affair is not all too clear. why did you cut a line from s love poem to  and why does  seem so flippant about the whole thing? i dont get it. the best part of this production is this family trio led by richard elmores perfect presentation of . he plays the role in a traditional manner and stands out from the rest of the very non traditional cast. blathering on at some point about the sun and the moon day and night but never deemed the fool. he doesnt have much control over his daughter as this  resists and talks back preferring to garden in her jeans flannel shirt and rubber boots versus obey her father. i dont get why s wardrobe edly improves with her madness mirroring the black suit and shades of the mourning  but direction is not at all in question as oglesby in muddied dress retells the drowning of the fair . like a well choreographed spirit under the direction of this shows choreographer rokafella flood washes into the scene and creates a magnificent dumb show of her own death. i like that donohue does his to be or not to be soliloquy as a true soliloquy but rauch relies on technology once again and wires  as  and  listen in fbi style. but the part i dont get is why  is so angry at  when she reveals shes been bugged. and then if hes going to feel so angry and betrayed why is  so surprised that  would be upset? it seems everyone knows too much to be so shocked all the time. the ever important yorick moment is  well  i dont get it. gravediggers one bill geisslinger and two played with amazing timing by the fabulous josiah phillips are entertaining although geisslinger needs to slow down on delivery if he wants his jokes to pack a punch. donohue and geisslinger have great rapport but when donohue recalls his memories of yorick and speaks those poignant words about death and the inevitable the scene lacks conviction and understanding. donohue doesnt even look into the face of this emblem of death. this is a pivotal moment in the play and without it how is  supposed to turn and act. the epiphany is lost. and ohhhhh my i do not get the players. rauch takes one hundred percent responsibility for turning the players into dj rap star dancers with lots of pimp bling flash and pizzazz fit for the club scene i tend to avoid. as a result hecuba is lost. the play within the play is lost. both lost in the too loud rapingdancingglittering interpretation of these ever important scenes. the words are gone. lost is s ideal vision of women in these scenes and thus lost is the opposing view of what he sees in  and in effect . lost is any cause to his affect. while u. jonathan toppos fight direction is exciting and well executed by donohue and desantos the final nail in this coffin is s death scene. its emotional or should be. he is dying or should be. we want to care. we want to cry even but how can we when  interrupts his own death scene by standing up and adding a freeze frame soliloquy to s perfect seven before going back to finish dying? no matter if what donohue relays is important to rauchs interpretation of the play there has got to be a better way to get this information across. i dont get it. like so much else in this show that has all the makings of something big this production of  is best left in silence. ,3,Tragedy,Negative
Hamlet,An Underground Hamlet of Inexplicable Transformations,Michael Meigs, going to see an austin drama club production of  is like alice falling down the rabbit hole. strange creatures inhabit this illogical world and relationships change in puzzling ways but the story and essential verse remain intact in this shortened version of . adcs venue is a house just off e. 7th street in austin texas. youll enter through a scruffy backyard surrounded by a chain link fence. when we arrived tech director jennifer fielding was standing by the gate on backyard duty. her question have you been here before? she wasnt challenging us speakeasy fashion rather she was offering guidance. finding ones way into the theatre space isnt easy the first time for that small house has been converted with curtains and a miscellany of improvised tiered seating creating a 25 seat ad hoc theatre. sightlines are so constrained that three closed circuit televisions offer alternate views into the corners of the playing space. lighting is provided by inexpensive floor lamps and wall mounted goosenecks wrapped with aluminum foil and masked with gels in deep red and blue. you can call it underground theatre except that it isnt underground. japhy and ellen fernandes and friends are more of a cult one that is dedicated to dark and somewhat deranged productions of the classics each done on half a shoestring. their output is impressive. in 2009 they filled thursdays fridays and saturdays with three week runs of talk radio    fool for love henry v the wizard of oz richard iii after the fall and now again  their fifth presentation in three years of the melancholy dane. japhy crafts and directs a six person  edited down for a two hour staging that includes two ten minute intermissions.  and  disappear as they did in laurence oliviers 1948 version. also gone are  and the gravedigger much to my disappointment. what remains is a quirky freudian psychodrama in which s language shines fitfully through the darkness. character transformations are striking and often inexplicable. rob novaks  dresses in white tights and a short dark tunic but sports a tyrolean hat and an ice ax as if old europe somehow slipped in space and time. although christopher harris proved himself an articulate and focused actor in adcs recent production of  harris portrays  as a dimwit with a pistol while casey allen as leartes sic looks like one of the three musketeers. there are more quandaries. kat eason plays a juicy  in a tight bustier. the remembrance that she longs to redeliver is a playboy magazine that she unfolds in provocative fashion to display the centerfold. the player king phones in his performance literally and the mousetrap is an eerie black and white pantomime broadcast on television sets. julio mellas  is a shuffler and a mumbler and when  skewers him through the arras neither  nor  investigate the identity of the corpse. after  berates her ellen fernandes as  responds with scornful laughter when her son sees the ghost. playing  director japhy fernandes applies an appropriately theatrical demeanor and uses impressive tone and phrasing although in an occasionally fluty voice. his strong personalization of the confused king carries the other actors like a big clear channel radio transmitter dominating other signals. the cast surprises us with the entirely unexpected and unforeshadowed means of s demise a plot development that suggests a rich and enigmatic under text. theres madness in this den but  isnt the lunatic. theres a potential treasure here but unfortunately it is never fully revealed. if you can bear the ambiguity youll take away some food for thought and perhaps youll develop a taste for austins alt .  runs december 10 2009   january 2 2010 at east 7th street austin tx  78702. email japhy fernandes at this email address is being protected from spambots. you need javascript enabled to view it. for more information on address and tickets. ,2,Tragedy,Negative
Hamlet,A Hotspur'd Hamlet and a Powerbrokering Female Polonius,Michael Meigs, director jeff hinkle and the city theatre cast led by aaron black as  give us a gripping up tempo version of the famous events in elsinore. scarcely more than two and a half hours in playing time elapses between the first challenge on the battlements and s dying gasp. this  fits well within the max bounds for todays young movie going public and gives them the bonus of a break in the middle for snacks and bathroom. the nearly full house on opening night offered the encouraging prospect of a well attended four week run to open citys fourth season. and its a good ride with some surprises along the way. aaron black offers a two speed . from the first in soliloquy or speaking to us directly in his monologues black establishes the princes intelligence. his deft timing and effective pauses show s mind at work and establish a bond with the audience. that affinity however does not last. in company with any but  or the player king black speeds up provokes and antagonizes. his diction is precise but as his lines move toward rant he seems to be less the master of his own thoughts rather they burst forth in hectoring images. though in appearance and demeanor hes somewhere close to 30 years of age this  busts the rest of the world with the selfish hatefulness of an adolescent. his pleasure in aggression paints him with more hotspur than . almost all cast members are of similar age. thats not unusual in austin theatre. we accept it as part of our willing suspension of disbelief.  and  look as if they could be classmates. tim brown as  is a big worried puppy ill at ease in his new kingly functions and touchingly dependent upon his queen. the fine actress christy smith as  dignified and confident dotes on both her boys rousing  to oedipal like fury. director hinkle makes a striking and successful decision in casting jeannie harris as  kings counselor and parent to  collin bjork and  shannon davis. slim and focused harris makes this  both a mother tweaking  nose as he kneels to petition  for permission to leave the court and a razor keen counselor almost a regent for the floundering . in harris mouth the few precepts admonished to  are not woolly minded expostulations. they are motherly teasing up until the slight break of emotion in the final few lines this above all to thine own self be true and it must follow as the night the day thou canst not then be false to any man. her subsequent grilling of  what ist  he hath said to you? has new resonance. a discussion of the princes tenders of love becomes a mother daughter lesson from a female powerbroker a realist who has survived intrigues and has given little away. philology suggests that harris could properly have been new baptized polonia but farewell it i will use no art. the most regal presence on stage is  mcneill as the player king both in his speech for hecuba and in the mousetrap. mcneills assurance in the players make believe contrasts with s apprehension and with s pushy pursuit of revenge. the setting is den in 1935 for no particular reason other than perhaps to explain the garage sale furniture used in the palace. action moves across and around a couple of generic platforms in citys small space. costumes are generally undistinguished. in some cases they are strange for example tuxedos are fine for court revels but are seriously out of place at a funeral. the costume choices for harris as the female  are gratifying exceptions. harris dresses with power and taste and the crisp cut of this counselors dress is considerably more military than garments worn by the guards by s ghost or by . sharp action and strong acting predominate over other more modest production values. shannon davis captures s oermastered disappointment and then the fury of her madness. collin bjork as the returning  is hot as flame and direct as a rapier. macarthur moore menaces as the ghost of the murdered  sr. and uses a similarly distant persona in the final scene when taking charge as . i eagerly anticipated his portrayal of the gravedigger remembering his electrifying performance last year as mad uncle gabe in august wilsons fences but the opening of the funeral scene unfortunately falls flat. moore is posted in the waist deep grave at the back of the platforms and he has to carry the opening of the scene solo. its awkward though possible to justify an extended two voiced dialogue with oneself however the audience may become bewildered when the actor breaks character with impromptu res and seeks to enlist them in that dialogue. such is the case. moore might have managed it with force of character if hed been positioned much closer to us. when he pushes us for the answer to his quibble who builds stronger than a mason a shipwright or a carpenter? i tried to remember the replies of the second clown marry now i can tell  mass i cannot tell. i wished for a crewmember or someone somewhere behind us to call out those perplexing replies.  and  arrive promptly however and saved us from further embarrassment. city theatres  carries its public along with its boisterous flow. aaron black is energetic and assertive if not always likeable. destiny arrives at a gallop and the corpse strewn stage in the final scene reminds us that a fury without reflection is more likely to miscarry than to succeed. ,3,Tragedy,Negative
Hamlet,Law Dares To Be a Great Hamlet,Denise Battista,its not unreasonable to raise an eyebrow upon hearing that hollywood actor jude law granted with a small bit of stage experience in his repertoire is daring to play his first ever professional an role on the london stage turn broadway. its not unreasonable to raise both eyebrows upon hearing this first ever shakespearience is the title role in the donmar warehouse production of  directed by michael grandage. three months in londons west end and a stop at dens elsinore castle led to full theatres and mixed reviews. this left much time for honing before opening night on october 6th at new yorks broadhurst theatre for a three month run one of those months in previews. in a recent interview with charlie rose law addressed the london reviews of his brash furious and aggressive  and introduced us to the idea of a more leveled out witty and confident prince for his new york run. this newfound balance proves just the ticket on the broadhurst stage. law offers weighty insight in soliloquy physicality in character and the sharp and quick witted prose weve come to know and love in dens tragic prince. laws  is balanced daring and exciting and pretty darn great. speaking an estimated forty percent of the lines in the play law is not only an interesting  to hear hes an interesting  to watch. its as though every moment is a perfect movie still and every movement a well choreographed dance step. law incorporates physicality throughout and infuses so much energy into the part that i nearly had to catch my breath. he also knows what hes talking about. there is no recitation or learning by rote here. its plain that after the year he was given to prepare for this role and after the three months of performance in london law intimately understands his character the language and the play as a whole. and dare i say it he considers his critics. the new york cast direct from the london run with the exception of geraldine james who plays  at the broadhurst is good great uneven and even miscast. law discounts the scholastic side of  but oddly so does  played by matt ryan. albeit dashing ryan chooses swashbuckling over scholarly in his black upon black boots and leather jacket hair pulled back but for wisps falling forward in a tousle sword shackled to his side. ryan offers more depp than depth although he and law have good chemistry when engaged in their back and forths. this production seems to forget that s inevitable role is that of timekeeper and orator he stays alive to tell s story time and time again.  and his duty as s trusted friend is lost somewhere in the sexy shadows. also lost is any sort of fear of and respect for the ghost of s father here played by  eyre. eyre seems to conjure the ghost of barrymore for both his portrayal of s murdered father and for the role of the player king. frankly hed be better cast in a production of paul rednicks i hate  so he may more appropriately bring the barrymore spirit to complete unrest. eyres depiction is dated and overly dramatic rapid and staccato in speech and utterly disjointed from the rest of the stage. antic disposition works for  not for his ghostly father. for all the passion emotion and energy law brings to  the relationship between  played brilliantly by ron cook and his children is fascinatingly cold and literally distant. when offering his brief bit of advice to  gwilym lee or interrogating  gugu mbatha raw there are at least a dozen steps between father and child and the conversations are to say the least proper terse and reserved. the siblings are tender and playful with one another when  offers some brotherly advice about  and his heartbreaking jump into s grave is wrenching and vivid.  comes across as reserved and unemotional with her father and in the nunnery scene she hardly seems upset or even frazzled that  basically calls her a whore. this is disappointing as it eliminates any sort of tragic love story between the two and then diminishes our sense of s despair at s grave. but mbatha raw brings something quite magical to her mad scene a moment of dark raw truly sad insanity set forth in song after emotional and distracted song. cook albeit quite small in stature is great with both drama and comedy. his  while reserved and a proper man of the court is wonderfully pompous and has a strange manner of moving  round the stage with trunk planted and arms animated about. cook also plays the gravedigger and proves the only one to date who meets and beats billys crystals performance in kenneth branaghs screen version of . cook as gravedigger has impeccable comedic timing and lighting speed wit in cockney accent and britches pulled up to his chest. kevin r. mcnally as  comes across as more staunch businessman than stately politician or seeming king of den but he shines in soliloquy whether with stubborn knees as though to plead with us for pardon or screaming in a momentary outburst do it england as he watches his kingdom and his queen fall in the final scene of the play mcnally offers a sense of isolation experienced by a man whose world has just come crashing down by his own hand. and in death this murderous king crawls on the stage floor like a zombie grasping at laws ankles before dying a vulgar death. the creative team is perfectly in tune. christopher orams set and costume design is stark and dark. the cast wears mostly black with shades of grey and splashes of white the period contemporary simple and timeless. a seemingly impervious black stage opens to layers upon layers of cold darkness with two towering sliding doors creating a backdrop that opens to an immediate black brick wall. this den is a prison with cathedral ceilings and dusty beams of light shining through the battlement like windows in a refractory pattern casting focal points and looming shadows onstage. neil austins lighting design is filled with mystery beauty and intrigue and mingles with sound designer  corks expanding and ascending compositions that underscore s intensity emotion and despair as well as a sense of anticipation without completion with notes of samuel barbers adagio for strings. large drapes of fabric drop from above to signify scene changes into the court or s bedroom. grandage offers a fascinatingly different perspective on the bedroom scene placing  in dark silhouette on the audience side of a sheer arras while  and  can be seen on the other lighted side. this approach makes  death all the more shocking as s blade stabs through the arras and toward the audience. from there all comes tumbling down in a graceful and glorious heap signifying a turning point in the play. after  death law straddles james  holding her arms down against the floor but the sometimes imposed freudian reading is thankfully not imposed here rather the poignant moment for  in his mothers boudoir occurs when  picture perfect stands next to the ghost unaware of the apparition. law displays a moment of internalized anguish at this bittersweet sight so honest and raw his pain permeates the theatre. that is why this  is to be remembered. this production pierces the senses with so many vivid moments and images. from curtains dropping from the sky like silk snow falling on s philosophical and seemingly calculated contemplation on the to be or not to be of being patterns of light mixing with the darkness to the attention law pays to his hands when all else seems to be out of his grasp these scenes and so much more will remain imprinted in the table of your memory. law offers wit and comedy and such energy in prose and in soliloquy he reaches for the anger and despair and the totally ludicrous nature of his impervious situation imbuing each word with inspiration and emotion. jude law dares to be great and is triumphant. my brows are now both back in their proper position as law has earned his rightful place as  prince of den. ,4,Tragedy,Positive
Hamlet,Evil Hamlet: O' Horrible! Most Horrible!,Denise Battista,catchyname theatre companys production of evil  seems provocative if you read their promos. every man wants to be king and every woman queen of den.  each relentlessly pursues their own interest. dramatic shock treatment handled elegantly.  a barebones exposé of hedonism. and so i went  the only promo that proves honest and fair is catchynames statement that this is  like youve never seen before. the first word that comes to mind is offensive. charlotte brockman plays  dressed as the nanny while snorting coke every five minutes in between eye rolls lighting cigarettes and sequined bolero changes. vonn scott bair doubles as an impotent  and a poor mans phantom of the opera ghost using the same voice my father did at guilford lake in the summertime when he told us silly ghost stories around the campfire. leer relleum wears a bad blond wig and bartends when hes not acting like hes acting like someone who has nothing to do with his character . the trustworthy scholar  here destroyed by larry rekow is never out of joints and wears a golden pot leaf necklace to accompany his habit. this is of course when hes not offering  more coke or smacking  on the rear end. rekow with an imposed brooklyn accent this production is supposedly set in a 1965 brooklyn bar apparently impregnated  but one wouldnt know this if one hadnt read the odd notes of script editor producer and catchyname theatres artistic director jim strope. this would likely explain why the physically stunning yet acting nightmare alexia lodde breaks onto the stage in her mad scene covered in blood. she either miscarried and placed the fetus in the brown paper bag she is holding or perhaps she aborted the child herself. not sure which one makes more sense. alex plant is no help as her brother  as he comes onto the scene in vietnamish fatigues cradling a bottle of cuervo acting as though he is acting drunk only later to return seemingly shell shocked as his method acting i use this term loosely leads him to obsessively and compulsively whisper under his breath for the rest of the evening. and what of ? i refuse to acknowledge there was actually a  in this play that lacks any sort of nobility. there is a guy names matt ingles who mouths his speeches and splits ears but he is no .  wouldnt show the audience playboy centerfolds nor would he sniff s dirty thong center stage in a frank booth moment i nearly walked out.  wouldnt refuse to ever look at the audience.  wouldnt dare say the word cunt on stage. no this is not  either character or play. the only thing i can come up with is that i was tricked into this evil experience a joke of sorts. the promos are certainly not honest. irving schulman claims the role of director as well as the gravedigger. he digs his own grave twice first by burying the gravediggers lines under his incomprehensible mumbles eyes closed and next by directing such an atrocity. schulman apparently came to san  to do stand up comedy. i do not find him funny at all. set design is minimal. a bar on which  does much snorting. a small table with chairs on which  does much snorting. a garbage can and some boxes. a body bag at one point. a shovel and a skull like thing. i have no problem with the minimalist approach but a cardinal sin in theatre is killing the lights blaring some music and rustling around the stage for two three four minutes in order to move a can or stand on point. every scene change leaves the audience in the dark for minutes at a time. this production lacks direction lacks actors who can act and lacks anything that resembles cohesion. the only entertaining part of my evening was during intermission when i leaned over to one of the ten people in the audience to inquire about her theatre companion. i say excuse me i notice you have a stuffed frog with you. is that your journalistic good luck charm? she is a fellow journalist. he enjoys the theatre she states with a serious look on her face patting her frog on the head and adjusting his stance so that he may better observe the stage. i faced forward again and stared at the floor for a moment considering her answer. i turned again toward the girl and her beanie frog who had his own seat mind you and i asked does your frog have a name? sigmund she stated matter of factly returning her pen back to the oral position before looking down at her notepad. i was left with nothing more to say after that but i would like to thank sigmund for helping me through the rest of the too long evening. from that moment on sigmund helped me to accept the absurdity of my situation while permitting my conscious mind to wander to thoughts that might tie freud into the production at hand. while freud certainly had things to say about  this is all i could muster in regard to this particular performance i started considering that freud both used and recommended the use of cocaine in certain cases of treatment. i thankfully began to tap into my unconscious mind repressing my desire to throw heavy objects at the stage. i also determined that i was viewing a production of  created by the directors id a tangled nightmare of neuroses and disorganization but lacking one key factor the pleasure principle.,1,Tragedy,Negative
Hamlet,Star-Studded Hamlet Offers Horror and Hilarity,Claudine Nightingale,hoards of expectant theatre goers have thronged the streets of stratford upon avon for the last couple of weeks attending the sold out run of this seasons  starring none other than the current dr. who david tennant. another sci fi star who is no stranger to the an stage star treks patrick stewart draws many to the theatre with his masterful performance of both  and the ghost of old  portraying both murderer and murdered. with such a high profile stars taking on the demanding mantle of  speculation on both interpretation and performance is rife. a dramatic and eerie opening to the play unassumingly drags the audience into darkness with immediate tension felt by the patrolling guards.   de jersey gives an engaging and troubled performance greatly contributing to the initially unsettled environment. the musical score by paul englishby is a lively mixture of ceremony and atmosphere accompanying and encouraging much of the intense pace of the action on stage. the royal family arrives with a rousing entrance so much so that tennants entry at this point goes nearly unnoticed. he is almost unrecognisable as he stands sombrely at the edge of the stage in a dinner jacket his hair slicked to the side.  patrick stewart after his quick change from appearing as the ghost moments before enters calmly seemingly friendly yet creepily calculated in his trade methodical speech. opulent costumes adorn the royal family apart from  himself especially  penny downie who appears in several stunning satin evening gowns with extraordinarily long trains probably too long as they interfere with the fluidity of her performance on more than one occasion. even from the start we see clearly the ed difference between most of the companys present mirth despite old s recent death and young s natural melancholy following this loss accentuated by everyone elses apparent lack of grief. tennants  is indeed a young prince. although aged 37 his slender frame and performance approach works well to impose a tender age upon tennants character portrayal. his first soliloquy illustrates his childish anger he appears lost and helpless. tennant delivers every line crisply and even within the first few scenes we see many more facets to his acting that arent always seen in his screen performances. tennants interpretation very clearly establishes that s madness is deliberately feigned at least in the initial acts of the play. s relationship with  appears a genuinely emotional one. the core of his problem is dealing with these emotions in conjunction with the other serious circumstances that are playing on his mind. i think tennant also shows us some resentment on s behalf that he cannot live the normal life of a young man. words words words is hilariously delivered again clearly showing his sanity at this point. this combined with visual asides most definitely demonstrates that there is indeed method in his madness. edward bennetts  mixes a hint of arrogance with a straight laced and stoic manner while   gale is light and whimsical full of the innocent joys of life in the opening scenes. this production highlights their filial relationship and for similarly aged audience members these two young adults are very easy to relate to thus bringing a highly tangible element to this family. gales madness is terrifying. her distress is spheric inducing near nakedness and sporadic exclamations of fright. crazed? certainly. believable? possibly not but by all means captivating and thrilling to watch.  return from france brings him to the fore having grown into a strong confident and vengeful man. his stuffy stoic arrogance is lost and he becomes a character akin to james bond bennett dressed as such in a black leather jacket and polo neck. unlike too many productions the  we see here is attractive admirable and powerfully masculine. even at this late stage the relationship between  and  is so much more tangible and accessible than other productions seem to bother.   ford davies is perfect. amiable but generally tedious his advice is always worth listening to but never in quite the quantity in which it is given. davies elongated idle musings are charmingly and humorously performed giving him by far the most laughs. during his proliferations the audience struggles feeling a connection with  as he   like the audience   makes innocent merriment at  foibles. this moment of connection with  complicates our relationship and judgment of him. throughout stewart portrays  as cold and calculating. never obviously malicious this does in fact make him a much more threatening and dangerous character. his soliloquy humanises him further he clearly feels guilt but crucially not enough to truly repent his actions. stewarts ghost is angry and formidable. he is persuasive and furious at the injustice he has suffered and his graphic description of death is harrowing. his passionate pleadings make s actions far more believable to the audience. instantly despair and melancholy seem entirely justified. the set design by robert jones is innovative with a mirrored concept pervading both stage and props. the mirrored background is particularly effective at key moments such as the fireworks sightings of the ghost and  death. and with a shattered mirror so s sanity disintegrates.  sam alexander and  tom davey are well portrayed as opportunists. they too expose s flirtatious side as she swoons and flirts with . as such our queens personality becomes more complex. although there are moments where she struggles with her actions she is also clearly a confident and aware feisty and flirty woman. tennants scenes with rosencantz and  are electric buzzing around them here and there like a scatty excitable puppy. their scenes are captivating and exhilarating as is the bedroom scene. here s sanity becomes an ambiguous issue as the ghost plays smoke and mirrors with his once wife and troubled son. a sombre ending follows the well portrayed and dramatic denouement of the play and sums up the eerie darkness that pervades this production. this coupled with the edge of the seat thrills and some fantastic acting from some of britains finest actors results in a truly rare theatrical experience and an abundant feast.,5,Tragedy,Positive
Hamlet,Hamlet As It Was Meant To Be,Tanya Gough,still scarred from last years less than stellar season and concerned about recent news of the stratford festivals administrative shake up i have to admit i approached this years production of  with considerable trepidation. my fear was somewhat mitigated by the knowledge that this production is directed by the illustrious rsc veteran adrian noble and is cast with some of my favorite long term actors from the stratford stable combined with some exciting and promising fresh blood. luckily from the moment the lights dimmed and the words whos there? rang out i knew i was safe. this is a great production. the show works on so many levels. the sets designed by santo loquasto are a masters class in how to use a minimalist set effectively. loquasto has boldly removed the signature festival theatre balcony replacing it with tall plain doors which serve as a simple canvas against which action can be created. the doors also open inward to great effect twice into clouds of billowing smoke to reveal the ghost once to allow the entrance of the actors delightful gypsy caravan and several times to represent alternate architectural spaces. beyond that the sets remain completely stripped bare often with only one or two pieces of furniture present to establish location. nevertheless loquasto has chosen these pieces so well and placed them so effectively that the stage always retained an organic sense of completion and solid sense of space. the early 20th century costumes are also solid and understated yet contribute a sense of earthy solidity and gravitas to the performers. a usually restrained but continually varied lighting design by michael walton further helps solidify the sense of place and atmosphere throughout. this visual framework in turn defines the nature of the action which takes place within its confines. the production is evenly executed a fine piece of ensemble work such as ive only seen once or twice here at stratford. ben carlsons  is strategic and deliberate in his madness which contrasts brilliantly against raw outcries of anguish and genuinely expressed emotional vulnerability. scott wentworths  may very well be definitive. its one of the rare instances of this role where one walks away with a full sense of  back story and motives which engender understanding if not outright sympathy for the situation he has created for himself. meanwhile  ricossa acquits herself elegantly and consistently as . geraint wyn davies returns from the shaw festival to portray  with a fantastic middle class administrative taint that also feels grounded and gives weight and credence to his comic turns. incidentally davies went blank just prior to the advice scene and covered so beautifully i ended up in an argument over whether or not it was intentional. one always hopes that actors will not forget their lines but the truth is that when they do and when they cover so brilliantly well thats really what theatre is all about. other highlights include the graveyard scene played with aplomb and perfect timing by victor ertmanis and randy hughson. the actors entrance is beautifully integrated and nicely self contained and the mousetraps prologue done as a shadow show on a curtain strung up between the central doors. the effect of the latter is both spooky and nostalgic and contributes nicely to the quaint gypsy esque traveling show. among the less admirable performances is  played aggressively by adrienne gould. gould is costumed in exceedingly childish clothing and is surrounded by items suggesting a super imposed child like innocence. the concept is interesting the childish trappings suggest excessive artificial control by her parents and provide fodder to feed her later madness. unfortunately gould approaches the role with a deep gruff voice and a wiry almost masculine body presence which works at odds with the visual concept. she seems uncomfortable and abrasive so we gain no sense of sympathy for her or her plight. also oddly out of place is stratford veteran james blendick whose ghostly apparition as s father is largely undone the moment he speaks conveying neither majesty nor mystery. all in all a distinguished wonderfully executed production one thats well worth the trip to stratford. the production still had a few minor bumps along the way but i fully expect these will iron themselves out within the next few weeks. by the end of june this could well be if not the definitive  of our time certainly among the most memorable.,5,Tragedy,Positive
All's Well That Ends Well,Arden Completes the Hamlet Triad,Ron Severdia, having provided what many consider the ultimate vehicle for some of the greatest acting of any era has been given a rebirth of sorts by editors ann thompson and neil taylor. this newly released  the texts of 1603 and 1623 puts the final pieces of the puzzle of  into place by publishing a companion volume to ardens  released last year containing updated versions of both the first quarto and first folio editions of the play. this wonderful ternion gives the serious students of  everything they need to delve deeply into the dane.while the arden  is based on the second quarto this edition contains both the first quarto of 1603 widely considered to be a bad quarto possibly recreated from an actors memory and the first folio of 1623 likely prepared from foul papers and drawing upon the second quarto. the current compilation helps the reader gain a fuller perspective on the complexities and evolution of the story especially when compared to the second quarto. taking into consideration there are five quartos and the first folio to choose from many scholars and theatre professionals concur the earlier second quarto is the most error free version and likely the closest to what  intended. to demonstrate the differences s famous speech in the second quarto readsto be or not to be that is the questionwhether tis nobler in the mind to sufferthe slings and arrows of outrageous fortuneor to take arms against a sea of troublesand by opposing end them.when comparing this to the same soliloquy in the first quarto presumed to have been written a year earlier we readto be or not to be ay theres the point.to die to sleep is that all? ay all.no to sleep to dream ay marry there it goes.this is only the beginning of the differences in the three versions. editors thompson and taylor have taken a conservative approach to editorial license. when there is any doubt in the interpretation like in s monologue in 3.3 they retain foul where its commonly updated to sole they primarily choose to retain the original version however incorrect current scholarship states. its widely believed that both the first quarto and first folio have strong merits for being considered viable texts so arden presents their readers with a literary smorgasbord by publishing all three in their current canon revamp. scholars and aficionados alike can examine all three texts cherry picking from the best of the best and comparingcontrasting the various differences.for those wanting to read the text without dominating annotations this book will be an obtrusive read. but if youre the kind of reader who regularly refers to the textual notes and commentary having them occupy the lower 25% 60% of each page will make a thorough exploration of the text much easier. since the editors opt for this approach instead of having both versions side by side for comon yet another case that this is a companion volume to the existing arden  fans of bertram  klimans three text  wont have the benefit of getting a line by line comon. thompson and taylor feel there are just too many differences in the texts to make a side by side approach worthwhile not to mention the first quarto is shorter by about 1000 words.the textual annotations are extensive and worth the price of the book alone. none of the material is duplicated from the  arden third series so this is all new commentary from two of the brightest minds in the world of . the editors have also added line indentation to preserve shared verse lines also an important criteria for the play.com texts as well as a production history of the rarely performed first quarto.  the texts of 1603 and 1623 is bound in sturdy and compact paperback and in hardback form and delivers the quality youve come to expect from arden. so if youre looking to find whats rotten in den this play is truly the thing.buy  the texts of 1603 and 1623 at amazon.com,5,Comedy,Positive
Hamlet,The Many Ghosts of Hamlet,Matthew Kellen Burgos,there is an argument that runs rampant throughout both academic and professional theatre concerning the right way to produce s work. many feel that his words need to be given a new more contemporary context in order to be shared with a new generation of theatre goers. others vehemently defend the text as a precise roadmap to a respectful production. the wooster groups  courageously thrusts this same paradox back into the limelight with their truly unique homage to richard burtons 1964 broadway production. obviously deciding on a definitive method of playing a piece of dramatic literature that is over 400 years old is a difficult task at best. however burtons production is widely regarded as one of the greatest  performances of all time. the wooster group clearly chose the iconic production for this same reason. as the actors mimic the 17 camera footage playing on multiple screens in the industrial looking space much is revealed about the incredible style of the 1964 production and more importantly the incredible text of  itself. reid farrington and  schnieder edit the film footage into a powerful and engaging multimedia presentation which not only has the simple fast forward and rewind maneuverability of an old vcr but also the eerie ability to make figures disappear from one moment to the next. this creates the sense of a supernatural visitation of burtons production into the post modern set design of ruud van den akker. however the most important impact of the highly edited celluloid is that through jump cuts cross fades and other adroit editing techniques the majority of the spoken an text is taken back to the original line breaks and scansion. the result is nothing short of an aural revelation. though first time  viewers would definitely have a tough time finding the various layers in this particular production those who know the play moderately will find the music underneath the text to be surprisingly illuminated despite the erratic physical language of the performance. in a way as the actors move their bodies to mimic the jerky editing and ever changing camera angles the movement direction natalie thomas frees up the actors bodies lending themselves more readily to  gielguds original 1964 staging. scott shepherd is especially successful at letting richard burtons performance inform his own portrayal of . though looking nothing like burton physically shepherd seems to let the ghost of the classic production flow through him naturally and with complete respect. ari fliakos also connects deeply with four separate characters in   s ghost and the gravedigger. fliakos moves swiftly between each physicality vocal timbre and costume making it easy for one to go the entire length of the play without knowing the identity of the individual performer. kate valk also shifts between  and  so seamlessly that the quality of her performance is almost overshadowed by her chameleonic ability. roy faudree casey spooner judson s and daniel pettrow all do a fine job of supporting the production elements by playing the rest of the prominent roles while shifting pieces of the set and representational costuming claudia hill. the casts work does wonders in re creating much of the ambiance of the 1964 production. wooster groups  isnt without a few confusing choices however. just as many of the editing choices serve to push the text into the foreground some of those same decisions detract from a few moments that warrant little change. there are also a few short songs sung live by casey spooner as  that do little for the integrity of the overall production. the songs fit well stylistically with the fantastic sg by matt tierney with contribution by dan dobson  collins and jim dawson but seem out of context with burtons production. there are also some clips of other contemporary films branaghs  as well as a monologue by bill murray as  from the 2000 version which though enjoyable obscure the ethereal presence of the classic broadway production that is woven throughout. overall the experience is a special one and at times a visceral journey that moves beyond the intellectual stimulus of its own post modern tone. elizabeth lecompte does an incredible job as the director of an extraordinarily ambitious production keeping both technical and creative elements moving in sync towards the plays inevitable conclusion. there will undoubtedly be those who will claim that this highly auteured production should not even take on the namesake of its title character. however upon further inspection wooster groups  keeps its focus distinctly on the text creating a white noise of sorts with multimedia and movement that aims to shed light on some of s greatest phrases. if you are in the los angeles area feel confident in purchasing a ticket for this truly unique production. at 2 hours and 45 minutes the play isnt for audiences seeking a quick theatre fix. however for those interested in something that pushes theatrical boundaries respectfully and courageously look no further. and because a theatre experience begins when you enter the door redcat the roy and edna disneycalarts theater is the perfect location to view this production housing a comfortable performance space and fascinating installation art in its lobby. it is a memorable night at the theatre and a completely innovative look at one of the most iconic characters in dramatic literature.,4,Tragedy,Positive
Hamlet,What's Going On? That is the Question.,Matthew Barbot,its immediately clear the moment you take your seat that the wooster groups production of  is going to be far from conventional. the modestly sized stage of the public theaters newman auditorium is littered with projection screens flat screen tvs and wheeled furniture. garbled bbc radio transmissions are just barely audible and the largest of the projection screens upstage center displays an image of an empty theater set. the image skips from time to time and is occasionally cd by a ghostly image of a passing subway train.  id like to critique the performances but that would be difficult to do. id like to say in effect that ari fliakos is a very engaging  brooding and dripping with malice speaking with a deep oily voice that kate valks portrayal of both  and  are over the top that scott shepherds  is mediocre. their performances however are not their own. projected behind the actors and on tv screens surrounding the stage which the actors often look directly at in order to better reference and mimic is the 1964 richard burton broadway production of  which was filmed from a great many angles to be shown in limited release across the country. the actors do an admirable job of imitating the film even making jerky movements to represent the ill preserved films tendency to skip about or mouthing the words and letting the film speak for them when the films sound drops out or becomes tinny. however even during this productions infinitely more interesting second act during which the projected film finally takes a back seat ones impression of the actors performance is marred by the knowledge that hes merely aping another actor.  the audiovisual component is not completely without interest of course. the film is edited at times to remove certain elements from the background projection certain characters for example which allows the company to more easily select what the audience is watching which is to say to make sure theyre watching the stage actor at a particular moment not the screen. the illusion of camera movement is achieved through the use of easily moveable setpieces the most prominent of which is a long table connected to a chair all of which is set on wheels. a pan left is represented by the actors and the table moving slowly to the right a cut between camera angles is represented by more abrupt movement. script cuts and the script is heavily cut down are often achieved by the actor calling fast forward or skip this. this sort of meta theater is prevalent in this production with actors  particularly scott shepherd breaking the fourth wall to comment on the film for example telling the audience wed better skip this  bit then because ms. valk is currently playing .  another humorous element is the filling in of degraded or lost portions of the 1964 film by replacing them with scenes from the excellent kenneth branagh and the much maligned ethan hawke adaptations. other liberties are far more confusing. at points casey spooners  sings monologues like rock ballads into a cordless microphone or scott shepherds  speaks directly into a mic on a stand or roy faudrees  speaks while seated on a scooter. its unclear what any of this has to do with either s  or richard burtons production of it.  the production becomes more easily enjoyable once one accepts that the wooster groups production of  isnt really about producing  at all. its more experimental the program states that the aim is to reconstruct a hypothetical theater piece based on the fragments of the 1964 film. but to what end? while experimental theater is often laudable just because its not hard science doesnt mean the experiment shouldnt have all the proper parts. what is the purpose? the hypothesis? the conclusion? its clear this isnt a reconstruction of the 1964 production as the actors go through pains to mimic the quirks of deteriorated film. if the aim then is to simply reproduce film onstage then why was the film as per the programs technical note reedited [ ] so that the lines of verse which are spoken freely in the 1964 production are delivered according to the original poetic meter. isnt that antithetical to the purpose? and still the question of why? to the performances detriment it seems company members dont know themselves.,3,Tragedy,Negative
Hamlet,Students Tackle Hamlet with Heart,Georgina Petronella, is the tragedy of a young man a student in fact who attends school in wittenberg. and yet in the professional world the danish prince is usually played by someone older. that is why it is refreshing to see student productions of  here at least the brooding one is really a beardless youth. mask and baubles production of  at georgetown university embodies both what is good and bad about non professional theater. the actors are all endearingly earnest it is clear that blood sweat and tears have been poured into their production. and it really is their production students are responsible for all facets of the show. in fact mask and bauble prides itself according to a press release on being the oldest continually running student theatrical society in the united states. so the students have heart even if some of the emoting is shall we say unconvincing. on the other hand some of the acting is a pleasant surprise. sarah taurchini is charming and thoughtful as  and her descent into madness is definitely watchable.  maurer as  is truly amusing as the well meaning advisor who never knows when to shut up. but of course most of the focus lands on  the longest role in . here the honor and the burden falls to matt macnelly. macnelly is a natural performer and the type of actor who will get cast as the boyish romantic lead forever. perhaps predictably he fares best in scenes with .the tormented lovers both dewy and beautiful are stirring as they attract and repel each other. macnelly also does crazy well but is less convincing in his famous soliloquies. he shouts and shouts and his speeches sound the same after awhile. lucky for macnelly he is inherently likeable onstage and thus gets away with a lot. the real problem of the evening is seamus sullivans direction. i left the theater without a clear idea of any directorial vision. and indeed the dramaturgs note states that those involved were wary both of recreating the  of the past and of over modernizing the play. the production takes a sort of vague unadorned middle ground and the result lacks something. it somehow isnt enough to simply stand the actors on the stage and let the text do all the work.theater is a visual medium and lacking amazingly electrifying actors we need something more decisive and creative to hold our attention. instead we get mostly uninspired staging. the actors spend far too much time planted center stage talking at each other. actors are so much more interesting when employed in some kind of physical business onstage and here the action lags because everybody is just standing around. indecision is of course what  is all about but there has got to be a way to make ambivalence more exciting. the production could use a jolt of energy from the designers but sadly their contribution is minimal. the sound design michael costa is very simple there are maybe ten cues the entire show and the silence does the actors no favors. the lighting design lauren cucarola is similarly spare the ghost is spookily lit but the innovation stops there. aliyah bhatia has designed a basic set consisting of a bench two chairs and a couple of ledges. blue stars are painted on the bench making it look vaguely like a flag. the set perhaps in keeping with the dramaturgs note does not evoke a particular time or place. the result is unfortunately not timeless but bland. caitlin kellys costume design is more exciting and shows a touch of creativity lacking elsewhere. the characters are all in modern dress is there anything else these days? with an admirable choice in footwear. the ladies wear pastel high heels and  marjory collado marches around in a flamboyant pair of mustard colored shoes.  is in black except for a pink tie perhaps meant to visually link him with a similarly hued   bennett. his sneakers retro chucks are cute but obviously never worn. my favorite costume belongs to  a baby faced derick stace naughton who is clad in ultra preppy gear cap a pie. and believe me georgetown students know how to do preppy. in his popped collar artfully untucked polo shirt and tasseled loafers he is a glorious sight to behold. although the production is flawed i found myself wanting to overlook the deficiencies. the  theatre did a version of  a few months ago and i could not help but compare the two productions in my mind. the  theatre certainly has more resources experience vision and talent. and yet that production failed to capture my emotion. mask and baubles meager little  however imperfect does have a couple of flashes of something heartfelt  caressing s stomach  sweetly smoothing his sons shirt and  playfully bopping his schoolboy pal with a newspaper. if nothing else we get the sense that these people truly care about each other which in effect takes care of their play.,3,Tragedy,Negative
All's Well That Ends Well,Long-Awaited Pomp is a Proud Display of the Bard's Circumstance,Tue Sorensen,opinions vary about how well branaghs somewhat pompous film version of  works. like virtually every production of  it does indeed have problems and it has had to make hard choices not all of which work out. one of the major problems with the movie is that it frequently approaches melodrama rather than drama owing to the fact that branagh apparently over dramatized it for commercial reasons sadly focusing on the title characters energetic rage rather than the intellectual pensiveness of the directors powerful and critically acclaimed stage version.  should be a character that the audience finds sympathetic. if hes angry and hysterical in too many places he will not appear to be the hero of the play whos continually contemplating cunning plans and projects. it could be argued that he is indeed very confused and emotional throughout the first four acts but it is also a fact that byzantine schemes were set in motion in his mind ever since he first spoke to his fathers ghost and he could not carry out such schemes without a great deal of emotional self restraint. this is of course another of the original plays inherentapparent contradictions where sundry interpretations must compete to make the most convincing case. arguably a modern peformance of  must focus chiefly on the characters supreme if flawed cleverness and branaghs movie misses its chance to do that which is a shame. another problem with the movie is that it is simply too bright. white walls bright lights rich colors everywhere. a few years ago i had a chance to mention this to dr. russell jackson a scholarly text consultant on the movie at a talk he gave here in den and he pointed out that instead of a dark moody atmosphere the elsinore castle had secret doors everywhere granted that point is well taken and it is not a bad idea but watching the movie again with this in mind this element still does not make up for the sense of the unknown that should permeate this play. the secret doors element never achieves the ominous feeling of metaphor or analogy that it attempts which results in the play being too gaudy and losing its trade sense of a thousand mysteries looming. this is the biggest problem with this production. but while its a significant problem it is not fatal for the movie. almost everything else works out absolutely beautifully. is branagh a mite too old for the title role? perhaps but this is by no means fatal either. his acting carries the part. thus die my complaints. even with the faults described above grave as they are the movies cornucopia of action and abundance of contemplation set it apart as a seminal  and even if its not quite as powerful a drama as it has the potential to be its still every bit the literary and pleasantly puzzling spectacle that it equally ought to be. a good performance of a  play should not simply be melancholy recital it should be an uproarious gamut of structured emotionality with every character being visibly surprised at the outrageous power and shocking beauty of the words he or she both hears and speaks. branagh understands this and let us thank fortune for that.,5,Comedy,Positive
Hamlet,"Words, words, words...although not as many as you'd think.",Claudine Nightingale,unlike most performances of  i have seen this is more a comedy than a tragedy intentionally so i am happy to say. also unlike most  productions this is surprisingly brief in just over 25 minutes get over it productions manages to pack in a musical dance as a preface to the play and a 60 second encore which whizzes through the entire performance all over again. although the opening dance sequence is justly intended as a modern interpretation of the renaissance tradition of beginning a play with song and dance the execution sadly spoils these good intentions. the dance which seems ill prepared is an unjust introduction for the genuinely original material that follows. the musical interjections are simple but surprisingly effective. similarly the staging and costume design maintains the raw essence of this production the location itself a first floor room above a pub on camden high street also encompasses a feeling that this theatrical experience is to be something new and exciting. nearly every member of the all female cast is dressed in plain pale but particularly striking clothing each wearing a corset and some with brightly coloured underwear on top of skin tight white layers. i suspect this costume design is laid heavy with subtext and double meaning perhaps a physical depiction of the sexual theme that is a central element of the play perhaps a feminist stance against the weak portrayal of women that pervades . however when i noticed that each actor had a luggage label attached to their waist with writing on for example s read chip butty i decided that there is much more importance in this lightning quick performance to focus upon than the over consciously symbolic costumes. this is a performance that certainly improves as time goes on. by the time the comically obligatory encore takes place the audience is undeniably drawn in. although this obviously harshly edited script seems to be moulded around a skeleton of the many famous lines from the original play it would probably be fair to say that an audience member would need at least a basic knowledge of the play to get the most out of this short performance. most amusing of all in my eyes is that whilst trying to fit at least three and a half hours of s words into just half an hour this troupe still finds time to fit in a whole minute of mimicry illustrating s boat trip overseas. perhaps theyve found that once youve cut all of s procrastination out theres really not that much left to say. despite the loss of most of the original material a cohesive and entertaining performance emerges. but watch out blink and youll miss it  get over it  is a production by get over it productions. this performance is part of the camden fringe festival which runs until the 26th august 2007. www.camdenfringe.org,3,Tragedy,Negative
All's Well That Ends Well,Richard Burton's Hamlet (1964),Tue Sorensen,as great an actor as richard burton is  and he is among the greatest   the single most distinctive feature about him is probably his booming voice. whether in the movies on stage or as the narrator in the brilliant recording of the musical jeff waynes war of the worlds burtons words reverberate with power clarity and enunciative perfection exhibiting the impression of an absolute mastery of the spoken word. who better to pair burton with than the one playwright in history who proves the absolute master of the written word? burton made his career on the an stage in stratford arriving with a splash as prince hal in king henry iv part 1 in april 1951 garnering rave reviews. he was 25. in the very same season he followed up this first success with the natural sequels henry iv part 2 and henry v though first digressing into the role of  in the tempest. in america he had already wowed american audiences on broadway in 1949 with the then new verse play by christopher fry the ladys not for burning. the same year saw his first appearances in british movies and he arrived in short order as a hollywood star when he appeared alongside  de havilland in the 1952 film my cousin rachel. burton was nominated for best supporting actor at the 1953 academy awards and won the best male newcomer award at the golden globes. though steeped in  since his youth at 18 he was in a 1944 production of measure for measure the mature burton appeared in only one film version of a  play franco zeffirellis the taming of the shrew 1967. but one mighty stage performance of his 1964  was committed to celluloid and subsequently shown in movie theaters enabling millions of people to enjoy burtons powerful portrayal of the melancholy dane. burton knew that this was the time to do  because at 38 he would soon be too old for the part. having reunited with his stratford collaborator sir  gielgud in 1963 on the set of the film becket burton told sir  that he would do  if gielgud would direct it. gielgud agreed. the performance came at the height of burtons celebrity status. the play was initially staged in toronto then came to boston ultimately ending up in a long and sold out broadway run. and right in the middle of it came his marriage to elizabeth taylor amidst a relentless media frenzy concerning burtons breakup with his first wife and his living in sin with taylor. throngs of people showed up outside the theaters to demonstrate against the immoral relationship while other thousands showed up as adoring fans. it is a testament to burtons consummate professionality that he managed to keep his head and deliver a stellar performance as  every night during this cacophony of public attention. according to the trivia page on burtons  at the internet movie database all copies of the filmed performance were supposed to be destroyed upon the end of the cinematic run but one preserved copy was discovered in burtons own garage after his death. whether this discovery is accurate or not the fact remains that burtons  is now out on dvd and can once again be enjoyed by the multitudes. it is a full conflated text version of the play more than three hours long containing only a few admirably strategic cuts. one or two minor speeches are shortened including s recital in front of the players. the filmed performance is in black and white and the dvds picture quality is not good. thankfully this is compensated for by a nearly immaculate sound recording and in the case of a burton  play this must be said to be the most important facet of such an undertaking. gielgud staged the play in the manner of a dress rehearsal   a so called final run through   with minimal props and no period costumes. the actors were free to choose their own clothing and they appear here in contemporary upper middle class everyday clothes although burton wears a thin black v neck sweater and black pants. almost amusingly even the three people portraying the norwegian army wear suit and tie. burton is as phenomenal a  as you have any right to expect. he infuses his broad shouldered portrayal of the danish prince with a believably robust pathos. his  never lets down his guard he is conflicted angry constantly suspicious ironic never trusting rarely smiling always pensive and always sensing danger. like an undisciplined child his voice oscillates wildly but despite his frequent lapse into flippancy he seems to keep all impulses under control   except when he sneeringly barks out the word woman at the end of frailty thy name is  at who calls me villain breaks my pate across plucks off my beard and blows it in my face tweaks me by the nose gives me the lie ithe throat as deep as to the lungs who does me this? burton whirls around as if beset by invisible enemies. he is strong enough to be confident yet hes never confident enough to fend off his fundamental insecurity. he never conquers his fear of the unknown at least not until the final act. when he is with the players and asks them to speak him a speech trying to remember it himself the players actually produce a book containing the speech and show it to . this is a variation i havent seen before. the 1st player still knows the remainder of the speech by heart though he doesnt need the book. when  is on his way to england and passes  army latterly going into the how all occasions do inform against me soliloquy burton strangely delivers it in a sitting calm and almost indifferent manner including the final from this day forth my thoughts be bloody or be nothing worth. i fail to grasp why burton performs this passionate speech in so throwaway a manner it reads like he has completely given up and doesnt really mean a word of it. i dare say it is also a shame to bypass such a great opportunity for burtons sonorous voice to reach new heights of intensity. it may however be part of the overall theme of contrasting strength of body with weakness of the will for if there is a single overpowering theme to burtons  it is physical strength.  is a man who needs to avenge his father by killing his uncle and has cause and strength and means to do it even if he doesnt quite have the will. grandly the imposing burton resembles a herculean  all the more tragic for never mustering the all important resolve to put his strength to use. besides this there doesnt seem to be any other strong statement to the production nor is any needed for burton is himself such a statement personified. the rest of the cast is capable but in comon with burton generally on the uncharismatic side. hume cronyns spot on  deserves the most distinction for masterfully mixing impeccable etiquette with comical confusion. the gravediggers too are particularly entertaining but the remaining cast is merely adequate.  and  fulfill their roles and not much more.  is the usual confused humble and restrained girl as seen so many times before and  is frankly a bit of a dullard bordering on the anemic.  however is a strong personality and a fitting opponent for burtons square framed . burton is the centerpiece of the stage and rightly so for it would surely introduce a jangled disharmony if the other actors were to upstage a lead character of such strong and brooding presence. choosing relatively uncharismatic yet quietly professional actors with which to surround burton was the correct decision   particularly now that the performance is only left to us in black and white so that there is very little to distract us from burton himself. at the end of this version of  one could be forgiven for remembering it as a one man show. and a fond memory it is. dvd extras apart from lists of filmographies for burton gielgud and cronyn the dvd features a brief 1964 interview with a chain smoking burton where he is asked to talk about theatro films experimental project of filming stage performances for subsequent projection in cinemas an ambition that was apparently considered very promising at the time but which we now know has sadly come to very limited fruition in the years since. the interview is interesting only because virtually any words coming out of burtons mouth have a nearly spellbinding quality. bibliography the personal and professional circumstances surrounding the conception staging and success of richard burtons  are recounted in a chapter of  cottrell and fergus cashins richard burton   a biography arthur barker limited london 1971,4,Comedy,Positive
Hamlet,Take Wing and Soar Productions' High-Spirited Hamlet,Elizabeth Bachner,theres always the danger that a bare bones low budget production will make a great tragedy seem smaller less frightening and less terrible. from the first moments of the opening act of take wing and soar productions off off broadway staging of  at the workshop theatre its clear that director elizabeth swain has used the sparse setting to create a sense of urgent intimacy. while this is a classic  with no great innovations or bells and whistles it brings a rare freshness and immediacy to the story.  take wing and soar productions was established in 2001 to offer classical actors of color the opportunity to take on the meatiest  roles and this  has a nearly uniformly strong cast. timothy stickney as  gives the prince a crumbling dark sobriety and mary hodges manages the difficult balancing act of portraying an  who is sweetly innocent and genuine without being vapid. the supporting cast is the productions real strength.  david heron captures the tragedy of  transformation from a sweet boy to a broken man gutted by grief and bryan webster gives a charismatic standout performance as .  michael leonard james lends levity as a hilarious  and first player and obie winner arthur french woos the audience as a quiveringly senile .  all have some form of classical training and know how to bring the language to life its one of those too rare productions where the audience can truly hear enjoy and understand s words.  one of my fellow audience members who confessed before the show that shed bought her ticket because  was played by r.j. on one life to live and hes a fine looking man left the theater excited. she said i forgot it was    it was like a good movie take wing and soar productions opens up  not only for trained actors of color but for aspiring actors and audience members of all kinds who respond to the diversity onstage. the casting diversity strengthens rather than dilutes the classical focus and the audience can feel this casts love of the language. there are a few flat notes in the production. at moments it lacks the sexual menace and depth of the strongest classical interpretations and the darkness of the family romance is often downplayed or overlooked to the shows detriment. there are also a few typical off off broadway glitches like lighting oddities and broken air conditioning but the cast maintains energy commitment and focus throughout even at moments when the best productions of  tend to go stale. this production straddles the fine line between profundity and entertainment managing to provide the audience with both. theres a true sense of sweet sadness at  death and the suffering it brings to his shell shocked children a real grief but the bloodbath at the end of the play so often lugubrious rather than moving has a delicious schadenfreude. its almost but not quite over the top. dark tragedy but a fun ride. there are a few flat notes in the production. at moments it lacks the sexual menace and depth of the strongest classical interpretations and the darkness of the family romance is often downplayed or overlooked to the shows detriment. there are also a few typical off off broadway glitches like lighting oddities and broken air conditioning but the cast maintains energy commitment and focus throughout even at moments when the best productions of  tend to go stale. this production straddles the fine line between profundity and entertainment managing to provide the audience with both. theres a true sense of sweet sadness at  death and the suffering it brings to his shell shocked children a real grief but the bloodbath at the end of the play so often lugubrious rather than moving has a delicious schadenfreude. its almost but not quite over the top. dark tragedy but a fun ride.,4,Tragedy,Positive
Love's Labour's Lost,Diverse Love’s Labour’s Does Justice,Ginny Quaney,in spite of its similar quality loves labors lost is not produced nearly as often as its more popular   and chronologically closest   comedic siblings a midsummer nights dream and much ado about nothing. even the colorado  festival has only performed it a handful of times including the 1980 production starring a then unknown annette bening as the princess of france. fortunately csfs cast and crew know how to handle one of s most criminally underrated comedies. director brendon fox doesnt attempt any clever conceits wisely his production fades into the background while s clever word play and intriguing characters take center stage. what his direction does add is tremendous physical comedy a winking mockery of melodrama and a unique depth to the four main couples. the tongue twisting puns and lightning fast banter are highlighted by nearly slapstick levels of physical humor   easily removed police hand restraints for ease of walking around for example or hiding places that require mild acrobatics. because of the numerous love letters read out loud for plot purposes the reading characters fade out while the writing characters speak their own words from a spotlighted balcony occasionally to the meta frustration of the character whose lines are being stolen. and each of the four main men and especially four main women receive a few subtle if small character moments that allows each their own distinct personality quirks. the set designed by stephen c. jones is exactly what one might imagine when presented with the idea of a kings court that has shut itself off from the world for the purposes of study. everything takes place in the outer courtyard of an aging ivy covered castle complete with balconies for the letter writers mini soliloquies and  like gazing upon each mans chosen lady. fittingly this sequestered and love forbidden courtyard also contains a statue of a naked couple kissing and a mildly phallic fully functional fountain   exactly as  would have wanted for such a punny innuendo filled play. while this production doesnt seem to be set in a specific time period or at least not one important enough to be featured in the directors note meghan anderson doyles costumes look vaguely pre wwi with the women in ankle length skirts and long sleeved blouses and the men in preppy suits with matching vests various colored cravats and the occasional bowler hat for the lower class folks. of especial notice is the costume of don  de  a delightfully over the top rafael untalan whose magnificent cape and military esque uniform bring to mind a beautiful cross between don quixote and dartagnan. the clever subtlety of the costuming implies that the action takes place sometime in the not so distant past but not so long ago that the lessons are irrelevant. the pastel color schemes make the men look like superficial frat boys while the women appear elegant and classy   and if thats not loves labours lost in a nutshell what is? but what makes or breaks a an comedy especially one as language heavy as loves labours lost is the talent and chemistry of the actors which this production has by the boatload. everyone is fantastic from servants  the always entertaining banter expert michael bouchard and  the chameleon like scott coopwood with their low brow raunchiness to the mechanicals with their smart humor matthew schneck and casey andree do much with their small roles of  and  respectively to the impressively accented don  to the ever constant straight man constable  dull grant bowman who with moth  adu sings a beautiful duet that closes the show. the four main men have superb chemistry and their gentle teasing quick falls into love and an standard ill advised foreign in this case russian disguises give them room to show off the character beats and strong relationships between them. the true superstars however are the women. while this production is perhaps the most diverse in csfs recent history its worth noting that every one of the four main coupled women is played by a woman of color and each actress brings a spark of unique personality to her character. desiree mee jungs princess of france is a formidable diplomat but she knows how to play hard too the entire lets prank those silly boys plan is hers and she more than holds her own against king  the adorable marco robinson and her saucy servant . her subtle reaction to her fathers death is heartbreaking and her deep friendship with the other women who gather to comfort her is never clearer than in that moment. amber scales plays  as a bookish mary bennet type complete with glasses and a prim exterior though she too can and does get into some dirty banter with . aziza gharib simultaneously gives  a try anything once attitude and the quiet wisdom to let others take the lead occasionally until she can see how everything will play out. and everything about brynn tuckers  is a joy to watch   she alone of the women wears a pantaloon skirt wide legged trousers that allow leg movement while looking like a skirt in certain poses. that with her oxford like blouse and tie bring to mind katharine hepburn as do her spitfire disposition lewd but clever banter quick wit and no nonsense interactions with  played by the equally good and excellently matched seth dhonau. she stands on ceremony for no one   not the princess nor  or even the king whom she dances with and excoriates in disguise. she takes the princesss plan and runs with it but is the only one in the end to require more of her would be suitor than a year long hermitage. she doesnt just want him to prove his love she encourages   and expects   him to be a better man. amid all that she is rarely without a smirk on her face or a twinkle in her eye. foxs directors note focuses on the pyrotechnic language of loves labours lost and the production does as well. csf brings to life an excellent version of s most feminist   and arguably funniest   romantic comedy.,5,Comedy,Positive
Love's Labour's Lost,A Labour of Love not Lost in Translation,Benjamin Alper,loves labours lost is one of the most difficult of s plays to perform for an audience. with its intentionally complicated and pretentious language the text does not lend itself to performance easily. when reading the play i often find myself wondering how in the world a company might stage it. with dialogue so dense and complicated for a reader to digest how will an audience be able to understand it especially when being performed at high speed? reably the atlanta  companys recent production of loves labours lost at the american  tavern manages to utilize enough physical comedy over the top acting and audience interaction to make this play thoroughly delightful. the play starts off slowly which gives the actors and the audience the opportunity to get comfortable with the text of the play and its themes. however the play explodes with life and energy when don  walks onstage.  played by  rodriguez in his first role at the tavern is so over the top that it almost doesnt matter what he is says because it all sounds hilarious. his interactions with  kings moth are some of the most enjoyable in the whole play. s appearance literally sets the stage for the broad physical comedy that takes place throughout the show. when the ladies of france arrive the play comes into its own as either a modern day romantic comedy or high school drama. and while the princess and her ladies are played wonderfully it is  matt nitchie who provides the most comic relief in their scenes. i wasnt surprised because i have yet to see nitchie deliver anything less than a reable performance in every show ive seen at the american  tavern. some of the most difficult scenes to perform in loves labours lost are those between the schoolmaster  and the curate sir . in spite of the highfalutin language and obscure literary references in the dialogue which make it inaccessible to a modern audience director jacyln hofmanns ingenious decision to cast  as a woman instantly makes these scenes not only more accessible but also very funny. the female  played brilliantly by mary ruth ralston and  played by the always funny vinnie mascola imbue their fairly dry dialogue with a barely hidden sexual tension which keeps the audience very much interested. these kinds of creative choices by the director both keep the audience engaged with these characters throughout and feel consistent with the themes of the play. in addition to excellent casting director jaclyn hofmann continues to showcase her brilliant and effective use of physical comedy. the last play she directed at the tavern a comedy of errors similarly excelled in this regard and ms. hofmann is quickly establishing herself as the go to director for an comedy. the comedy of the play culminates when the king and the lords dressed as russians in a failed effort to hide their identities perform a traditional russian prisyadka dance and attempt to woo the princess and her ladies in thick and clearly fake russian accents. the outright absurdity of this scene cannot be fully appreciated just by reading the text of the play or by reading this review and it is this scene that most clearly demonstrates the importance of seeing  performed as opposed to just reading the texts of his plays. audience interaction is practically a necessity in the relatively close confines of the american  tavern but there is a fine line between too much audience interaction which can distract from the overall enjoyment of the play and none at all. this cast seemed to delight in interacting with the audience more in this performance than in others i have seen. a play like loves labours lost allowed the cast to freely interact with and play off the audiences reactions and kept the audience engaged. all in all this production by the atlanta  company elevated a difficult play to an enjoyable evening of entertainment.,5,Comedy,Positive
Love's Labour's Lost,Slow-Paced but Light-Hearted Love’s Labor’s Lost,Jennifer Kramer,the quintessence theatre group offers their production of loves labors lost opposite  fords the broken heart in their love  longing repertory. in addition to offering a playful take on the crooked meanderings of love and courtship their production acts as a love letter to the play itself   for better or for worse. director and setsound designer alexander burns immediately establishes the sunny tone of the production with a simple yet effective stage. the cyclorama at the back though it occasionally changes color for dramatic entrances primarily shows the blue skies of a bright clear day and the thrust stage is covered in astroturf suggesting a bucolic setting but also hinting at the athletic shenanigans to come. four topiaries   one for each of the would be scholars   sit on the raised dais at the back of the stage setting up a long fuse of subverted expectations in act 4 scene 3  and the king closely shroud themselves in the first two bushes but  panics and freezes in place pretending to be a statue instead. christina bullards costumes achieve a colorful naturalism while still suiting characters personalities albeit with a few missteps with fitting    in particular is ill served. the king and his companions wear their privilege on their sleeves with their preppy dress code of three piece suits blazers and bow ties accented with bright colors even  as the most informal still wears an aqua button down shirt and red blazer with his khaki shorts and rugby hoodie. the princess and her retinue meanwhile are both more formal and fashionable striding onto the stage as down a catwalk in stylish modern dresses and admirable heels. s cut off plaid shirt jeans cowboy boots and trucker hat immediately position his social and personal identity as does don s black leather caballero outfit perfectly coordinated with moths matador uniform. bullards creativity shows itself with her work on the costumes for the roles the characters assume within the play. the aesthetic of the russian habits can best be described as marxist gangster basketball boy band   groucho not karl   with mighty moustaches short shorts gold jewelry and jerseys helpfully labelled russia to allay confusion. the costumes for the five nine worthies meanwhile range from realistic a metal breastplate and overly revealing pteruges for the decrepit sir  as alexander vaguely authentic if sparkly jewish regalia for  as judas maccabeus to fantastic an infant hercules in lions head slippers pompey the big astride a costume horse and hector in black leather topped by a red feather boa and matching sparkly thong whichever is more appropriately hilarious. apart from a few performances that need a little polish and the accent of don  josh carpenter which is difficult to understand in some places the acting is quite good.  s makes an affable  who sneaks his most outrageous statements past under a layer of reason and charm. dana kreitz as  achieves an opposite effect weaponizing the cutting precision of a high school queen bee and the attitude of a femme fatale. daniel miller plays  with a comedic enthusiasm that makes it difficult to determine whether the character is a dumb hick the only sane man in a ridiculous society or something somewhere between the two. as the princess of france mattie hawkinson exudes the wit sophistication and aura of command of someone who innately yet graciously expects to be the leader of any social circle. the productions weak spot is its pacing. burns calls loves labors lost a play of ostentatious sophistication with a beauty and wit of language that remains unmatched by any other  play which perhaps explains his reluctance to trim the text. every quip no matter how obscure or occasionally racist is faithfully rendered at the same deliberate pace working against the casts energy and allowing far too much time for contemplation by those who dont get the joke. even the beautifully composed and  performed madrigals of the plays closing songs go on for just a bit too long. combined with blocking that tends to live up to its name and obscure eyelines the result is an unfortunate exclusion of the audience. however there is no denying that burns passion for the play is sincerely conveyed by the cast and crew. the quintessence theatre groups production is not some dull yet scholarly tribute but a clever transformation that blends s wordplay and the actors comedic talents with perfectly timed theme music and abba dance parties   an inspiration for enthusiastic appreciation in a new generation.,4,Comedy,Positive
Love's Labour's Lost,The Extreme(ly) Funny Love’s Labour’s Lost,Jennifer Kramer,once again the pennsylvania  festival has returned with their extreme  production. the actors arrive with their lines learned commandeer one of the sets raid the psfs closets for costumes and props and in just under a week work out the direction of the play themselves   just as theater companies did in the days of . this year they offer loves labours lost emerging from these challenges with a fantastic and funny production. scenic designer steve teneycks majestic set from   is not the intuitive choice for the light hearted production but in addition to a certain neoclassical academic je ne sais quoi it also soon proves well suited for the barrage of fourth wall breaking jokes. besides general acknowledgments about the theatrical spaces existence when  cries theyll mock us now downright  helpfully corrects him with down left the cast also points out the sets minimalist aesthetic as when  notes i have been closely shrouded in this  bush  with a dubious glance at the theaters curtains. the cast gets a lot of mileage out of the automated movable dais whether to add instant gravitas to their speeches no matter how ridiculous or simply to provoke more laughs as they ride it across the stage with varying levels of enthusiasm. the costuming has a vague 60s feel which works out well as the main characters conflicts resonate with the echoes of the clash between old boys clubs and womens lib. the princess and her ladies look smart in colorful dresses scarves vintage sunglasses and gloves. the king and his men meanwhile range from very to unbearably preppy  does not wear socks with his suit the king pairs a navy sportcoat with a pink buttondown and white pants  wears boat shoes white bermuda shorts and both a sweater vest and a cardigan.  and s costumes would be impressively accurate even without the productions limitations the former wears a tweedy looking suit with a beltline somewhere in the vicinity of the armpits under an academic robe and mortarboard while the latter sports a full curates outfit   though without shoes. however it is don  de  who makes the biggest impression his combat boots maroon beret dog tags fingerless motorcycle gloves sweeping cream long coat baggy black drop crotch trousers and orchid colored tank top provide a perfect mix of military chic fashion consciousness and utter inexplicability. the cast is uniformly excellent and offers what seems like the entire range of possible comedic performances. as the princess of france marnie schulenberg mixes poise with playfulness obviously taking a break from her normal dutifulness to indulge the sheer absurdity of their situation. in contrast mattie hawkinsons  has a distinctly sharp edge to her wit though she never goes quite too far her companions warnings to avoid savaging anyone seem fully earned. zach robidas gives  a similar mean streak though it is clear he rarely tries to be too damaging. by making it clear that both characters naturally default to sarcasm and mockery hawkinson and robidas increase the impact of the revelations in act 5 s confession is as heartfelt as s shock at his sincerity. with an impressively thick accent  lawton gives don  de  a butch edge to his foppishness. he balances s considerable ridiculousness with a genuine care for others whether it is for his lower class love jacquenetta a vivacious beth egan his tender juvenal moth a scrappy  danelski or the audience members whom he conscientiously reassures that the line no evil angel butt love is not a dirty joke. nor is cupids butt shaft. the master of audience asides and ad libs however is christopher patrick mullens . mullens dry and low key delivery provides the perfect counterbalance to his tendency to go off script in practically every scene including the customary pre show plea to check out the psfs other shows and to turn off cell phones. such is the caliber of the cast that even minor roles are a delight and this is nowhere as evident as in justin ariolas performance as constable dull. merely by sitting on a corner of the stage with a pipe and crossword puzzle ariola conveys an unflappable steadiness could as easily come from a calm practicality as from genuine dullness the result is surprisingly endearing which makes dulls enthusiastic for him metaphorical appearance as cupid   complete with bow fairy wings and pink silk toga   even more charming. the cast takes full advantage of the plays focus on words and how people say them and delivers a whole array of pronunciation jokes. in addition to mocking don s grandly accented vocabulary the navarrans also deliver some linguistic contortions themselves love is frequently given its an pronunciation for no particular reason and as russians whose dialects include schwarzenegger and robot the king and his friends deliver the impressive request for piss and genital whiz itation peace and gentle visitation. if there is any complaint it is that the actors comedic accents are occasionally too thick to catch all the jokes theyre delivering. with so many great comic performances it is unsurprising that very few scenes have been cut and in fact the actors actually add some material. cutaway gags like the king and companys group selfie after their academic cap toss at the very beginning or cupids appearances throughout the play keep the laughs constant. there are also frequent musical breaks whether inspired by the text like  ode to a pricket warbled to the tune of greensleeves or not  and moths bilingual duet of frank sinatras my way. though certainly full the deliberate pace   and quality of the humor   largely keeps the production from feeling overstuffed. however it is the casts knowledge of when not to be funny that ultimately shows their mastery of the form. after the delivery of the news of the death of the princesss father the tone makes a definite shift to sad though not somber an appropriate elegy for the romances cut off just when all parties realized they were in earnest. the ending is nicely bittersweet as the lovers farewell each other over a soft rendition of the plays closing song   just in time for one last gentle joke as don  helpfully points out the theaters exits with you that way we this way. just as the characters have their reunion to look forward to the cast of the pennsylvania  festivals production of loves labours lost reminds us that their talent humor and creativity will also have a chance to return in a years

Love's Labour's Lost,"Vows, Chaos, and the Restoration of Harmony",Yuko Kurahashi,i had the memorable experience of attending the great lakes theater production of loves labours lost on s birthday in this 400th anniversary year of his death. directed by tyne rafaeli this production underscores the contrast between men and women over sex and love in the an arena. while the text alludes to the king and his courtiers vow to renounce women to become more honorable men rafaelis direction takes the play in a different course by making the vow into a game that young men might play. this approach allows them to jubilantly compare their relative strength against the opposite sex. in harmony with the king of navarres speech our court shall be a little academe still and contemplative in living art rafaeli sets the play in a university library designed by kristen robinson with monumental bookshelves with a big arch entry in the middle and two smaller entries on the sides. on the top panels of the shelves are the names of the nine worthies historical and legendary figures who are known for their valor knowledge and military and political skills. the additional names of two characters in the play    the schoolmaster dougfred miller and  the curator m.a. taylor   serve as a comical but important bridge between the worthies and the play. two sliding ladders open a vertical dimension in the setting as they allow the performers to climb up and down the bookcases. the collegiate setting for the academe is reflected in the costumes as well designed by andrea hood.  the king of navarre jonathan dyrud  christopher tocco  jeb burris and  nick steen all wear tweed jackets with a crescent as a school badge so they look like british schoolboys. the noble men and womens world contrasts with the world of subplot characters  and  as the epitome of schoolmasters and clerics the spanish nobleman don ariano de  david  smith his page moth robyn kerr  the maid maggie kettering  the prisoner juan river lebron and the constable  dull tom ford. the central character in the sub plot is  in a khaki colored overall construction workers gloves and cap lebrons  tricks the lords though often clumsily. fords constable dull a deadpan reminds me of mr. yunioshi as portrayed by mickey rooney in the film version of breakfast at tiffanys. his nonchalant presence acts as a counterpoint to the hyperactive . the play of the nine worthies performed by these characters for the noble men and women mocks the ancient hero pompey. s parody of pompeys prowess may suggest how  saw heroes in both history and among his contemporaries. rafaelis direction emphasizes the power of the women to ruin the young courtiers plans to remain celibate. the women build   literally and figuratively   a fort to protect their virtue. they are not objects of the masculine desire nor threats to masculine purity. princess of france erin partin and her three ladies in waiting laura welsh berg christine weber and heather thiry challenge the men with their impeccable fashion while the mens appearance becomes disheveled. the womens command of the situation is underscored by the costuming by hood. they are first seen in long coats and berets. their militant entrance to upbeat music composed by josh schmidt captivates the audience more so than the presence of the four noblemen in the first scene throughout the performance the womens costumes remain colorful conspicuous and mesmerizing. their embroidered coats bare feet and rifles in act iv scene 1 illuminate their role as hunters. although the women are also hungry for sex they exercise control over men as well as fashion and decorum and stand in clear contrast to the king and his lords who become frantic and confused. the state of the four young mens minds is demonstrated in the form of physical theatre. when the king of navarre and his three lords make entrances to the stage they often use openings in the shelves and as they knock books to the floor physicalize the distracting influence of their sexual appetite and frustration. during the courting scene with a mistaken identity routine after the four men find their right partners both men and women chase each other like children in a playground. in the midst of the havoc created by these noble children in the playground rafaeli reminds the audience that these people are also at the mercy of political conditions. the sudden news of the death of the king of france signaled by a change of lighting rick martin lighting designer suggests the dark reality of international politics that will separate these lovers. the play ends with a lap song performed by  and  sitting in two chairs left behind in the disordered library. this finale suggests the end of the academic year and a return of peace to this academic kingdom yet foreshadowing the turmoil to be caused again by these four students in the fall.,5,Comedy,Positive
Love's Labour's Lost,Labours of Love from the Classical Acting Academy,Jennifer Kramer,the classical acting academy at the philadelphia  theatre the free eight week course designed to introduce young professionals to both the acting techniques and performance of classical theater has returned with loves labours lost a bright and lively production of a light and witty play. the weeks of preparation have not gone amiss as the whole cast gives some very strong performances. terrell green plays a likable and long winded  king of navarre whose grandiose sense of fun occasionally overwhelms his common sense. in contrast  roberts as the princess of france is eminently down to earth playful and good natured even as she cuts through nonsense. her retinue follows suit the wit of  madalyn czerniak is more penetrating than jesting while the ladies  janice mcduffy and  gracie martin refuse to sacrifice the camaraderie of their circle for their love fool love interests. yet despite playing the role of straight man each maintains their characters clear appreciation of a good joke. fortunately there are many to be had the cast is particularly talented at both verbal and physical comedy. joshua kachnyczs  is ruefully funny and his normally overshadowed friends  and  jason beckmann and brandon essig respectively make up in background gags the development they are denied as side characters. the clowns meanwhile each have their own individual quirkiness. lizzie spellmans  has the quick wit unfortunate luck and complete lack of mind to mouth filter of a comedian escaped directly from vaudeville nicholas scheppard gives don  de  a fantastical spaniard an almost charming lack of self awareness and the graceful physicality of a slightly drunk ballerino. even more minor roles are memorable eren taylor brock reaches a definite honorificabilitudinitas with his performance of the hilariously uptight and pompous  the schoolmaster while a very funny stephanie n. walters imbues  with equal parts sweetness and wild rampaging flirtatiousness. the production makes great use of its motown soundtrack the perfect complement to the actors energy. the costume design is similarly retro though much less specific  has her vaudevillian pork pie hat and bow tie the dresses of the princess and her ladies give off a vague 60s vibe and s bowler and bulky suit transcend time with their encapsulation of stuffy britishness. costume changes are equally revealing of character. after learning she will be living in a field for the duration of her visit the princess exchanges her minidress and preppy pearl set for a practical plaid shirt and bean boots her ladies follow suit and spend the rest of the play happily in casual outdoor attire even while entertaining the king and his friends. the latter meanwhile consider formalwear to consist of putting on a suit jacket and russian costumes to include a fez a necktie headband fake mustaches and fake mustaches repurposed as unibrows. alex bocks set design is particularly suited to both the production and the play. made entirely of sheets of paper covered in writing it evokes the texts preoccupation with learning and poetry and with delivered and discarded love letters. most of the set consists of heaps of crumpled pages rhythmically swept into new positions during the musical interludes between scenes and perfect for showcasing the youthful high spirits of the main characters as they get into leaf fights and hide in leaf piles. in the second half of the play the curtain is pulled back to reveal a small copse of paper trees even the masks donned by the princess and her ladies are made from paper. director aaron cromie has an intriguing approach to the end of the play a potentially unsatisfying romantic cliffhanger with a lost sequel. the plays light hearted tone takes a turn for the serious when the princess receives word her father has died a brief but poignant bit by roberts. the ladies admit they hadnt taken the gentlemens protestations of love seriously and though promises are exchanged they must be delayed for a year as the princess and her retinue return to france. however cromie follows these final lines with a musical montage showing the passing seasons the king and his buddies finally devote themselves to their scholarship monarchy 101 pre med womens studies and russian  commits to  and their baby and the lovers are at last reunited. by providing this resolution cromies ending shows the characters growing up without growing out of all the qualities that made them so entertaining in the first place. the classical acting academys production of loves labours lost is both a celebration of youth and a hopeful take on growing in maturity a perfect match for its cast of rising actors already excelling with their futures still ahead.,5,Comedy,Positive
Love's Labour's Lost,Love's Labour Wins,Eric Minton,of all the witty wordplay and romantic poetry in loves labours lost the plays most magical line just might be a simple observation by  at the end. when he and his companions are told they must wait a year and a day before the ladies they love will grant their suits  says thats too long for a play.  is here winking at his audience and the american  companys tempt me further tour troupe picks up on that clue and turns this elizabethan wordfest into a modern funfest a jocund gathering of them and us together creating a great thing called theater. i love this play but ill be the first to admit its language is way too obtuse for me in places. obviously this can be a huge obstacle in a play that derives most of its humor from its language in the way of puns sophisticated put downs and characters unchecked verbosity. however the language is not an obstacle in this production. director jim warrens judicious trims of the text help and the accessible setting serves the script well too. based on the costumes designed by victoria depew the action takes place in the 1920s with the princess and her ladies in waiting wearing flowing bejeweled flapperish dresses the king in a white sportsmans sweater bearing a shield shaped badge on his breast and his fellows in three piece suits. this navarre could be a gatsby country estate set on the outskirts of dayton tennessee. moth scampers about in overalls  is a hee haw bumpkin in tidewater pants vest way too short polka dot tie and fedora and the  just stepped in from deliverance. with  in sweater vest and academic cloak dull looking like a keystone cop and don  dressed as a bullfighter depews visual characterizations put s language characterizations in easily identifiable context. warren also keeps his cast focused on their characters purpose and the productions ultimate goal of providing whimsical fun for the audience. and what a collection of characters. loves labours lost contains some of s most singular creations. theres the hilariously funny such as the excessively romantic spaniard don  and the excessively arrogant schoolmaster  these are two of my favorite characters in the canon for the way they stroke their own egos with superfluous synonymy. theres the subtly comic such as the well meaning but naïve king of navarre and the wittily wise princess of france. and theres that lawyer of love . and what a cast too. weve been fortunate this year to see some top to bottom brilliant ensembles such as the asc renaissance season company and the casts of new york classical theatres twelfth night and oregon  festivals all the way and again we are treated to a company with every cylinder firing at full force the tempt me further tour troupe was doing a blackfriars playhouse preview run before heading out on its national tour. the company gets a broad canvas with this play on which to display its talents thanks to the doubling of so many key roles. stephanie holladay earl is the elegant princess dispensing her wit prettily and she is the white trash page moth guffawing his jokes with fist pumps. lexie helgerson is the self assured  flirtatiously teasing  and she is the stiff h priest  prim proper and celibate. bridget rue is the quiet reserved  another of the princesss ladies in waiting and she is the overly overtly sexual  lying on her back making love to s words as  reads his miscarried sonnet. david millstone is the dullish  and the educator extraordinaire . jacob daly is the hyperactive  and the hillbilly  and seth mcneill is the confident confidante  and the stooped shoulder dimwitted dull who following s direction stumbles over the name signior  but in a clever updating we can hear him mistakenly read the name as signior armadillo and signior ahmadinejad. from scene to scene these actors sometimes barely have a line in which to change costume and character holladay earl and mcneill in particular must have a bottle of polyjuice potion at hand to translate so quickly and effectively. the final scene with the presentation of the nine worthies features the royal coteries and country folk at the same time a total of 14 characters played by a cast of 11. warren and company employ no theatrical metaphor or clumsy dual playing rather the double role actors unobtrusively slip off stage as one person and return the next minute as another do their worthy and leave coming back again as their first person in time for their next line. it works because this production does not try to aim for any higher concept than entertaining its audience. indeed the plays success comes from embracing that mission wholeheartedly at every turn even before the play begins. modern music is a mainstay of asc productions in addition to acting chops this cast features skilled singers and musicians too and the music is integral to the plays overall theatrical experience. the preshow concert contains such thematically chosen songs as mary chapin carpenters shut up and kiss me elvis presleys a little less conversation and a mash up of my guy and my girl. during the intermission the cast performs another fitting mash up n syncs tearing up my heart and spice girls wannabe. snippets of appropriate songs pepper the play throughout such as sam cookes dont know much about history carol kings will you love me tomorrow and the monotones who wrote the book of love. the navarre fellows call on a romantic guitar with a snap of their fingers to accompany the reading of their sonnets and though disguised as muscovites they greet the princesss train by singing the backstreet boys i want it that way and snippily depart with n syncs bye bye bye. one half of any theatrical experience is the audience. its too often a forgotten half but this cast involves the audience any way it can. the great four way reveal scene has each of the kings courtiers hiding amid the audience. patrick midgley as the king speaks his sonnet directly to a person sitting on one of the on stage gallant stools and in the production we saw the elderly woman receiving his love words feigned infatuation so well midgley himself led the audience in applauding her. patrick earl as  effectively captures the audiences confidence with his speeches and his cupid soliloquy is one of the plays highlights as s archaic mythological references take on modern connotations i never before realized how funny that speech can be.  the clown can be the plays most obtuse character but in his country loll and w.c. fields mannerisms  goldwasser makes him laughable as well as lovable. then theres don . rick is ridiculous i wrote in my notes and that is truly a compliment to rick blunt who is this generations will kemp. warrens genius was in casting his companys kemp not as  more of a kemp type role but as the overblown spaniard wearing too tight matador britches and when presenting hector as the ninth worthy too short toga. using an extravagant spanish accent and walking with flourishing gestures this don s very stage presence is as overblown as his passion and language. heck thats the case even when blunt isnt actually on the stage as his two letters are read out loud the king and  lip synch to blunts flamenco like voice coming from backstage. its a funny device in and of itself but it also hammers home the absurd language of the letters one of s best pair of comic set pieces.  however never wrote any of his plays on a single emotional plane and warrens troupe recognizes and respects that even in the fun staging of this loves labours lost.  and  get into a bit of witty cattiness begun when the former makes a disparaging reference to the latters dead sister and helgerson and rue carry out this scene with such testiness that the princess physically steps between them by contrast the parallel cattiness among the men arguing over the merits and demerits of their respective loves is played solely for laughs. when we come to s shocking ending the sudden dramatic weight of the play falls on the princess and holladay earl who in last years tour played hermione in the winters tale so exquisitely pulls off this tricky mood shift with absolute assuredness. in light of this switch from sunny comic romp to a play that begins to cloud the charge  lays on  to spend a year of bringing comedy into the tragic settings of hospitals and hospices takes on added significance. all the worlds a stage one of s characters would famously say in a later play. another of his characters would implore his audience to believe the stage to be all the world. in this loves labours lost the characters stage and our world meet and mingle for two plus glorious hours. after the ladies enforce their year and a day sentence on the gentlemen after the country folk in this production the whole cast sing about the owl and the cuckoo in a musical denouement don  speaks the plays last typically obtuse line the words of mercury are harsh after the songs of apollo. you that way we this way. but blunts  is emphatically clear in his meaning as he addresses this line directly to the audience and points which way for whom. and so the actors depart through the stage exits but we dont yet head to the theater exits as commanded. it takes three raucous curtain calls before we finally reluctantly let go of the play.,5,Comedy,Positive
Love's Labour's Lost,"Love's Labor's Surfin' Safari in Austin, Texas",Michael Meigs,robert fairess imaginative staging of loves labors lost takes place at the sheffield hillside theatre in zilker park literally a stones throw away from austins barton springs spring fed swimming pool. spectators spread out blankets or set up lawn chairs in the sloped meadow above the playing area and settle in for the pleasures of free entertainment for a texas evening in may.loves labors lost is one of s earliest comedies and not one of the worlds favorites.  the language is rich and strange certainly to a contemporary ear with lots of quibbles puns and references that might have knocked em over back in the late 1500s but today come across as dense and obscure.the concept seemed to be a stretch.  how were director faires and that energetic young cast going to fit the king of navarre the princess of france fantastical spaniard don  de  and sundry counselors and ladies in waiting into an annette funicello frankie avalon 1963 beach blanket bingo world?having made his reputation with the histories of henry vi and richard iii  was drawing on events of recent history for this lighthearted comedy.  he was parodying henri of navarre a contemporary and an english ally in the religious wars until henri abruptly converted to catholicism in 1593 shortly before  wrote this piece.  henri was reported to be of an intellectual turn of mind and he had received visits from a french princess and the french queen celebrated with festivities and entertainments. references to other current topics and events are frequent.  s characters both noble and common obsess with words and elaborate wordplay.in loves labors lost king frederic of navarre has enlisted his three counselors to dedicate themselves with him to study and asceticism for three years foreswearing the company of women during that time.  of the three    all of whom bear names drawn from accounts of court life in navarre    only  questions the undertaking. the king and his fellows persuade him to sign the formal oath. their good intentions are immediately undermined by the visit of the princess of france and her mostly female retinue. much of the play involves the mens initially surreptitious courting of the lovely visitors.   breaks up that silliness with other comic figures    the spanish knight of grotesquely orotund phrasing the knights comical juvenile sidekick schoolmaster  of almost incomprehensible erudition the randy swain  arrested by constable  dim and other rustics.after considerable dithering the counselors and the king confess to one another their neglect of the oath.  they disguise themselves as bearded russians to flirt with the women visitors but the women with their own disguises mock their artificially hirsute courtiers.  identities are eventually revealed but before the dances of romance can begin in earnest the princess is called back to her court.director robert faires has worked some magic with this staging.  loves labors lost was for its first audiences a comic portrayal of recent history with in jokes scattered about the script.  faires modifies the language virtually not at all    instead of being lodged in a field the princess and her company are lodged on a beach and my ear may have caught the word deck used for court at one point.  the director serves up pop culture references in the music and in the movement that work an effect of amused recognition with the 21st century audience.  a summertime radio soundtrack precedes the action the first music heard is wipeout by the ventures.the princesss women do a saucy shirelles style dance step when teasing the men and her counselor  delivers some of his lines in credible imitation of frank sinatra grooving before the big band at the sands but mostly drowned out by the recorded music. the spanish knight does a long bossa nova entrance down the boardwalk and james bond music punctuates the russian sequence. the concluding songs about spring when daisies pied and violets blue. . .  and winter when icicles hang by the wall and dick the shepherd blows his nail  are warbled with guitar accompaniment to the tune of the byrdss i was so much older then. costumes are eye catching and comic in themselves from the jackie k outfits to the 1960s bathing suits to the gaudy beach shirts of the surfer guys and the beach setting is ornamented with a sweeping boardwalk and colorful striped tents for bathers.that surfboard in the poster and in the first scene is unintentionally symbolic.  faires and his cast know that the casual audience for this free admission  in the park is going to be baffled by much of the language so they establish a fast pace and a brightly kinetic acting style that keep everybody surfing on the crest of the text.  intonation and movement tell most of the story whenever the verbal play is too complex or obscure.  often the banter flies so swiftly that anyone not having read the play can capture the rhymes and the rhythm but not a great deal of the wit    in fact at times not a great deal of the meaning either.those who do have some familiarity with the text will be pleased by the crisp enunciation and appropriate interpretation but theyll long for a button somewhere that could slow the phrasing down by 20% or so. for example   scheibmeier as the cynical wit  gets the task in iv 3 of providing  rhetorical justification for abandoning the oath of asceticism some salve for perjury urges his buddy dumain. s 75 lines of blank verse are as densely conceptual as s sonnets written at about the same time.  they conclude let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths. it is religion to be thus foresworn for charity itself fulfils the law and who can sever love from charity? scheibmeier delivers this speech so quickly and vigorously that the message we retain is little more than s opening line have at you then affections men at arms and the kings response to the speech saint cupid then and soldiers to the fieldscheibmeier an austin  alumnus and 2010 mfa graduate in theatre from the university of texas returned from los angeles to take this role.  like him almost everyone cavorting on stage in this cast of fourteen has appeared before for austin  or in other quality local productions of .  they know what theyre doing and under faires guidance they do it extremely well.  nancy eyermann a newcomer in austin has a particularly appealing self assurance as the princess of france.my favorites are the clowns and rustics.  faires splits the role of  dull in two probably to take the most advantage of the droll michael dalmon. in the opening scene dalmon appears as  dim the constable a sort of tall and hairy barney fife in act v dalmon is  the schoolmaster in a three piece suit intoxicated with prolixity and having drunk far too little from the pierian spring.  in this lengthy scene judd farris who plays counselor  doubles in the role of a taciturn  dull transformed with harold lloyd glasses striped suit and straw hat and a mainer accent.david yeakle as the would be suave spaniard don  and molly karrasch as his sprightly juvenile sidekick are clever and comic.  faires gives karrasch a succession of role playing identities and she sparkles in each one.  michael amendola plays the goofy swain  big and dopey a sort of maynard g. krebbs on steroids.at the intermission the cast will come bounding out of the playing area with jokes and baskets so youll get the chance to toss some currency in there to support the ongoing and expanding program of austin .this is a fine evening of theatre and a gift to austin. its colorful funny accomplished and  all together.,4,Comedy,Positive
Love's Labour's Lost,Love's Labour's a la 1940s,Christopher Adams, guildford lies forty minutes by train southwest of london where it is blessed with a vibrant acting scene and expansive castle grounds. the guildford  company now in its fifth season makes use of the outdoor space to stage their summer production of loves labours lost. the natural setting works well a product of the companys emphasis on site specific theatre. for instance when the king of navarre matt pinches says sweet leaves shade folly he has only to motion to the towering leafy tree covering the audience to make his point. picnicking and picturesque scenery combined with the long lingering summer solstice makes for a pleasant evening of light entertainment. this production plays on a 1940s french theme. as director simon usher explains in the program notes the choice to provide a design with a 1940s flavor was born out of a desire to meld a sense of formality with the possibility for more relaxed and abandoned behaviour. this sense of place is helped even if unconsciously by the real life boules court behind the stage complete with elderly couples having a go at the game. the era most shines through in the costuming by production designer amy cook in which the men are appropriately suited and the women wear hats gloves and post war dresses tasteful and elegant. a gazebo entered into somewhat awkwardly by two ladders stuffed full of books lights and a french flag completes the set. the staging makes use of the large open space which expands lengthwise though it is quite shallow allowing for dialogue across a long distance. one quibble the audience is seated in chairs on a downward angle with the stage at the bottom of the slope. while this arrangement allows for a good view of the characters as they run off into the distance as they frequently do since costume changing locations are quite far afield action which occurs near center stage especially when the actors are seated cannot easily be seen by audience members in the middleback rows. through a combination of cutting and strong verse speaking this production turns what can often be one of s less linguistically accessible plays into a lucid and coherent dramatic presentation. the text is helped by humorous turns from the companys joint artistic directors pinches king of navarre and sarah gobran princess of france. the two show a fully developed sense of the relationship between their respective characters with gobran playing the princess as knowing and a bit acerbic making full use of impeccably pursed lips. as the simpering affected  pinches delivers a winning comic performance nailing s utter pretentiousness as a trousers in socks wearing latin quoting fop no offense to those who actually speak latin. as for the rest of the cast the company enlists eight actors to fill a total of sixteen parts resulting in the doubling of several parts and in the case of rikki chamberlain the tripling of parts  don  sir  chamberlain is at his best as the strangely endearing don . stephen darcy as  is at his best during the plays serious ending after the princess has learned her father the king of france has died. darcys intense manner fits the suddenly somber mood. the actress working opposite darcys  annie hemingway shows great skill as  elegantly moving about as she banters with . the opportunity to engage in pleasant game[s] comes crashing down at the end of course the announcement of the king of frances death throws a damp cloth on the shortened presentation of the nine worthies. in the aftermath the ladies in the guildford production reveal the extent of their toying with the mens hearts. any true attachment is superficial in this battle of the sexes the women manage to keep their hearts intact leaving the men to suffer under their new oaths to live as hermits for a year though there is much doubt about their ability to keep such oaths given the rapidity with which their original oaths were cast aside. it is a bittersweet ending to a more serious production of s early comedy. ,3,Comedy,Negative
Love's Labour's Lost,Love's Labour's Lost in Translation,Denise Battista,what should be in the words of harold bloom a great feast of languages fast becomes a table of scraps. and what a disappointment it is as its londons globe theatre that takes the stage at cal performances zellerbach hall for a brief five day run of loves labours lost before continuing its north american tour in california massachusetts and new york through december 21. this is the third time the globe theatre has toured in north america bringing acclaimed productions of twelfth night and measure for measure in 2003 and 2005 respectively. this time round the players under the direction of dominic dromgoole offer up an aesthetically gorgeous production of loves labours and while the creative team gives us an elizabethan dream to put it plainly we cant hear what youre saying and thats so important.  had so much fun with language in this relatively early high comedy thought to be written in 1594 with an edit by  in 1598.  tests the limits of language and surpasses our expectations whether a castrating volley by the princess and her ladies in waiting the quixotic flamboyance of don  or one of s famous monologues that simultaneously provokes and delights. on this stage the actors speak too quickly too quietly too indirectly and with too much accent. then dromgoole proceeds to cover it all up with over the top antics and slapstick. its fun to look at something pretty for a time but almost three hours time and this loves labours is lost in translation. jonathan fensoms set and costume design are positively decadent. elizabethan gowns give the impression that the ladies are floating across the stage the academes wear scholarly robes or capes drapes and ruffled collars and don s musketeer hats come complete with ostentatious plumes although the panache in his hats far outweighs his panache with language. set design is simple yet thoughtful offering a ptolemaic heaven above earthly trees growing on panels stage left and right in this seeming garden of eden. just below the heavens is a balcony on which musicians on bagpipe recorder viol horn and percussion create a lyrical opera of sorts. claire van kampens compositions are fun and entertaining and work to introduce accompany and gibe the actors and action on the stage. sadly s wit and arrogance are lost when we are unable to keep up with trystan gravelles rapid speech. tom stuart as  the lord who attends the princess speaks clearly enough but stands too much on point leading one to zone out in the midst of his monotonous monologue of rhyming couplets. michelle terry as the princess of france is absurdly extreme to the point that i truly expected her to start screaming off with their heads after whipping a flamingo out of her dress. the endearing don  is outdone when paul ready overdoes his spanish accent. i know part of don s charm is that hes difficult to understand but he should not be altogether incomprehensible. fergal mcelherron as  is a saving grace. this rustic clown gives us slapstick and bawdy humor and defines his name well.  means apple which metaphorically means a mans head. yes i mean that head. mcelherrons depiction of  is part soupy sales and part benny hill. and while  is led by his libido mcelherrons depiction is utterly and understandably brilliant. and now i must jump to the end as so much in the middle is just sort of forgotten for lack of language. there are some memorable moments such as the life sized manually animated deer that prance through the audience before offering metaphorical foreshadow when these harts are slaughtered during the hunt. thomasin rand as  is sharp and full of spunk as s love interest and foil although its tough to give credence to her fight when this plays  is so forgettable. but these memorable moments are episodic and punctual. looking around the theatre before intermission people slept. during intermission people left. after intermission people read their programs. not good. the final scene of the play should be a smorgasbord of excitement between the rude antics of the would be lovers and the ridiculous play within the play put on by a troupe of amateurs. dromgoole goes for something over the top turning the smorgasbord into a slapstick food fight and as our excitement turned sour long ago frankly were just bored with the absurdity. thats not a good thing considering this final scene adds up to almost a third of the plays text. whats lost in this production is eloquence a labour of language lost for the sake of in your face slapstick a shtick that should have been left to .  also lost is any sort of authentic pathos for any of these characters living in this mad hatters world. its s final words that sum up this production best thats too long for a play.,3,Comedy,Negative
Love's Labour's Lost,Labor No More to Enjoy Love's Labour's Lost,Cynthia Greenwood,textual scholars hushed inside the academy still wince at playwright colley cibbers 1699 adaptation of s richard iii in which he cut the bards speeches and added gratuitous dialogue of his own. their critical disgust is understandable. on both stage and screen it is s and not cibbers script that has stood the test of time. but the same cannot be said for the pithy and inaccessible loves labours lost which presents itself as a problem comedy for many directors. the script of loves labours lost definitely shows its age creaking with opaque jokes about literary forms that were growing passé in s own lifetime. contemporary theatre companies have been known to provide subtitles during performances so audiences can understand what they are watching. nevertheless when careful presenters handle this abstruse script its ornate lyricism reveals a delightful story. on one level loves labours lost parodies intellectuals and idealized medieval love stories and as marjorie garber reminds us in  after all it uses the conceit of the little academe to point out mans tendency to deny natural urges toward love sex and pleasure. on another level the play gently lampoons a group of naïve nobles for deigning to deny lifes earthly pleasures. during the texas  festivals four week summer repertory director tom whitaker and music director stephen lias stage the plays action involving four sets of aristocratic lovers beneath a raised soundstage featuring the stunning torch singer angela shipley and an engaging three piece band. by setting s story in the early 1950s and interspersing the sensual rhythms of familiar tunes director whitaker elegantly underscores the misadventures of romantic love enhanced by misdirected letters and masquerades. accompanied by piano bass and percussion shipley steamily interprets tunes from the 1930s and 1940s such as keepin out of mischief now i could write a book hard hearted hannah and they cant take that away from me. in essence the plot of this romantic comedy is quite simple. king  of navarre convinces his three lords   and  to sign a written oath to renounce women and pleasure in favor of three years of study and contemplation. at the outset  vigorously questions the kings goal but he eventually goes along with the plan. the nobles high platonic ideals are soon undercut by reality when the princess of france and her three ladies send word of their need for an audience to conduct official business. though the ink has barely dried on the kings oath he and his men admit the ladies on the grounds outside the kings palace so as not to te the strict terms of their vow. complementing the romance is s comic sexual intrigue featuring lowborn figures such as  a swain  the braggart and spaniard his page moth and the hot blooded wench . whitaker and his team wisely decide to cut the distracting subplot involving pedants  and  the curate. loves labours lost places great verbal demands on the most talented of classical actors. texas  festival tsf audiences are privileged because the company has a tradition of attracting players with a classical bent and a reverence for s verse through annual nationwide auditions. throughout this production the entire tsf ensemble presents a masterful performance. purists enthusiasts and casual playgoers are assured to hear every word of every verse in this well directed show. actor  hutchesons deep baritone voice imbues the role of the king with a courtly quality that served him equally well in the part of   last season. matthew simpson deftly inhabits the role of  the loquacious skeptic. reminiscent of the quibbling signior benedick in much ado about nothing simpson dances and quips his way into the heart of the formidable  wisely and sensually rendered by the poised heidi wermuth. while playing  j. hernandez brings impressive subtlety and grace to the role as does caroline crocker in her elegant vision of the princess of france. in their respective roles of lord  and ladies  and  actors kevin barber lindsay hicks and kristi forsch enrich this talented ensemble. michael krek is commanding and facile as  the lord attending the princess. actor aaron white who succeeds admirably as  should be commended for never overplaying a difficult comic part. darrin murrell fares well as don  and while mary candler cuts a visually stunning figure as the wench  on a couple of occasions her sight comedy is slightly overdone. costume designer joel ebarbs fifties era coat and petticoat dresses appear luscious on the four women. moreover the ladies complement of vintage gloves pearls satin pumps and seamed stockings lend the requisite formal air to scenes involving the nobles. this production is heightened by the dance choreography of stephen terrell particularly in the early scenes of act five as the four reunited couples bask in the glow of the dance floor before monsieur  arrives and dampens their merriment with news of the french kings death. although the idea of interspersing music between the scenes of an inaccessible elizabethan comedy might rankle a scholar such as harold bloom tsfs adaptation most certainly improves the playgoers understanding of one of the least audience friendly plays in s canon.,5,Comedy,Positive
Love's Labour's Lost,Shakespeare's Seinfeldian Comedy,Michael Kostroff,unofficially known as the sit com where nothing happens the highly rated seinfeld nevertheless ran for a whopping nine seasons a rare score in the world of disposable entertainment. and we loved tuning in to watch those four under employed self analyzing neurotics muse and plan and theorize and somehow accomplish so little. in a similar vein though in all likelihood not inspired by the tv hit loves labours lost is unusual among s work in that there is no war no great storm separating identical shipwrecked twins no family feud no big event in a sense nothing happens. there isnt even a villain at least not the living and breathing kind. but it could be argued that in this story the villain is the form over functional use of clever language for its own sake and the love of ones own words an indulgent reveling in the verbal sword play of rhetorical debate when these characters might have been far better served by plain spoken expression compassion and honesty. for after all the overblown vows and latin wordplay and pranks and masks and flowery correspondence the play reveals the meaning of its title as  in a resonant and bold move leaves us without the requisite happy ending one would expect in such a light piece. no wedding. no big closing number. a fluffy cake without its frosting.rounding out their second season the charming and refreshing porters of hellsgate offers this pleasingly perplexing comedy in a cozy little theatre in north hollywood amidst a backdrop of painted walls that vaguely recall the work of the french artist rousseau imbuing the small boxy theatre with a sense of freedom and frivolity that helps one forget its squareness. the show isnt perfect but its good and here in hollywood where so many stage offerings seem designed only to attract the attention of tv casting directors its hard not to be won over by the plucky art for arts sake enthusiasm and commitment of this youthful company formed by three ans barely out of high school. its hard not to root for them these new generation thesps. their love of the bard their respect for the language and a genuine desire to entertainingly convey its meanings to their guests are evident.so while the quality of the performances may be uneven and while the set is clearly cobbled together on a budget and while the curtain call may be awkward and sloppy its hard not to grade on a curve. when all is said and done the short review is this in loves labours lost the porters of hellsgate offer playgoers a truly good time at the theatre.all three founders of the company appear in this production with  pasternak doing double duty as director and star a combination traditionally discouraged in theatre and one for which this production suffers a bit. an outside eye might have corrected some of the clunkier staging and weaker lighting cues and fused some of the missed connections between actors. nevertheless onstage pasternak gives us a wonderfully appealing and relatable  who is at once critic and victim of all the frivolity and he does so with such charm wit humor and presence that he lifts the level of all around him. like a an fred astaire hes so good at his craft that he makes his partners look good. among those on stage partners are several applause worthy stand outs including matt calloway who delivers s comic consternation with the easy un pushed performance that is the  of a confident pro. dan sykes as moth is a sarcastic beleaguered over the whole thing servant and brings to the role a wonderful gift for making us forget were hearing archaic language. the same is so of the delightful dylan booth vigus whose constable dull in trying to keep up with all the verbose intellectuals goes from plucky attempts to utter despair to total lack of interest with truthful and satisfying comedic results. and bill quade in two tiny roles brings such touching honesty and depth to those humble endeavors that one cant help but fantasize about what magic he might do as lears fool or s .special mention must be made of gus kriegers deftly silly work as mr. i love the sound of my own voice himself don . young mr. krieger has made the audaciously risky choice of doing  with a thick castilian lisp coupled with a strangely loose tongue resulting in a giggle provoking speech pattern that looks and sounds as if hes perpetually sampling offerings at a spanish wine tasting. and yet krieger has fully justified that audacity artfully and solidly landing comedic hits while miraculously managing to be more clearly understood with the accent than many of his colleagues who arent encumbered by such oral calisthenics. hes broad but grounded and along with pasternak provides one of the highlight characterizations of the evening.kriegers top notch performance is slightly diminished by the confusing directorial choice of having him skulk ghost like past characters who presumably dont see him to share the reading of his letters with the character doing the reading sort of a split screen effect which is not called for by the plays text and requires a larger space and more sophisticated lighting to carry off. at the very least the on stage balcony might have offered a better sense that he was in another location. and the confusion is compounded when  reading one of the letters interacts directly with the formerly invisible .and speaking of strange choices i was hard pressed to justify the occasional breaking of the fourth wall in this production by random characters at random points mid dialogue. soliloquies and asides delivered directly to the house are de rigueur but this business of stepping out of a scene walking up to a poor helpless audience member with the bad fortune to be sitting in the first row looking into their eyes and acting at them is both uncomfortable and nonsensical. similarly baffling is thomas bigleys choice as  to playfully shove his princess a poised and elegant samantha stinger sometimes in the head. it would seem that the dictates of rank and protocol might suggest other behavior. our lovely ladies said princess and her court good solid actresses all seem at points to have made a backstage bet to see who could get her lines out the quickest leaving many of us unable to grab the ideas as they flew by. also lacking are discernable differences among their characters or much in the way of personal stakes. none seems torn apart with romantic rapture nor shy nor giddy nor cautionary nor lusty. these i want to emphasize are flaws in approach not ability and id look forward to seeing any of these talented women on stage in the future. also to be fair one could easily make a case that these are not s most complex and meaty female roles. after all this is a play largely about frivolity.a particularly surprising success is in the area of costuming one assumes theres little budget for this either where designer jessica pasternak miraculously manages to suggest a period look evocative of the great gatsby another story about people who have all and yet nothing. her dandified  the overly flamboyant don  a hotel doorman like dull and the tweedy professor ish  are stand outs alongside her well designed gaggle of college boys and lithesome ladies.do not for a moment be put off by the few minor shortcomings mentioned here. the porters of hellsgate are a talented bunch and loves labours lost is a worthy and entertaining production. but do know that this is not a production for theatre snobs. attend with a spirit of acceptance and openness and adventure as i did and as i was you will be very glad you came.on opening night the small house was nearly full always a happy sight. and it seems this company is succeeding where others have failed in attracting younger audiences close in age to most of the cast whose approval was expressed with applause and whoos at each black out.so go. go to north hollywood to both enjoy and support this young and delightful troupe of players. go for the fun of it. have some hearty laughs while your bard loving hosts work their magic in loves labours lost. just dont sit

Love's Labour's Lost,A Sylvan Setting for Love and Laughter,Claudine Nightingale,a light hearted and almost frivolous play productions of loves labours lost almost always guarantee a blithe theatrical experience rather than the morally or emotionally challenging experience of many other  plays. this seasons production of lll at the globe is no exception. the basic yet highly effective set alterations wonderfully evoke sylvan surroundings a symbolic arena in renaissance times for freedom from the formal constraints of ordered metropolitan or courtly society. much befitting this atmosphere several deer puppets make guest appearances throughout the play. they are a hit with the audience and they greatly add to the creation of a forested world within the entirety of the globe as they move elegantly through the groundlings and toward the stage. stage extensions are once again a feature in this globe production allowing both players and audience to come even closer and become more intertwined in this intimate theatrical space. even the musicians finely and uniformly dressed add to this sense of the theatre space as a representation of all the world by playing from every conceivable angle of the globe offstage onstage outdoors completely and even up in the seated galleries.,4,Comedy,Positive
Macbeth,A Fast-paced MxBeth Filled with Beautiful Sounds and Fury,Diana Louise Carter,shake on the lake is based in perry ny a village in a county locally renowned for its dairy cow census being higher than its human population. from this bucolic setting the festival this year is celebrating a decade of  productions and has grown from a handful of performances in one location to two weeks of touring in several nearby counties. theres joy in being able to put on live theater again after our long period of public quarantine. that joy is never more evident than in shake on the lakes production of mxbeth a 90 minute whirlwind adaptation of  its first full scale production since 2019. whether in the ruins of a former church or on the sloping beach of silver lake the cast of six actors with a couple more in the ensemble convincingly portrays battlefields of scotland misty moors and a chilling castle harboring evildoing. one totally forgets its a sunny summer afternoon in upstate new york. the pandemic delayed the start of this years production by about a week as covid 19 made its way through the cast and crew starting with the director chad bradford and costumer sharon combs as they traveled toward perry from their home in arkansas. when i saw the production on its new opening night understudies were filling in for one actors various roles and at least two people in the company were wearing masks as they were still getting over the virus. two nights later some of the masks were gone but the understudies were still on stage. nevertheless that opening night was electrifying and perhaps even more so because it took place in st. josephs park a historic former church in downtown rochester that sustained a fire more than 50 years ago and now comprises only the exterior stone walls and bell tower. it feels like a castle. all of shake on the lake productions begin with a 30 minute pre show a series of bluesy toe tapping songs performed by the cast accompanying themselves with accordion guitar and various percussion instruments. its in this warm up act that the audience first hears the stellar voices of ashley winkfield  et. al and selena mykenzie gordon lady  et. al both beautiful on their own but even more mesmerizing when they harmonize. then the cast minus the title character begins the play with another song whose lyrics repeatedly reference howling at the moon signaling the madness to follow. there is no preview though for the actor in the title character rick blunt whose brawn first appears as he and  encounter the three witches who forecast his rapid ascent to power.  who is twice shown killing someone with bare hands trembles before the weird sisters. blunt plays him as a skilled killer who is timid off the killing field but gains confidence in a crescendo building throughout the play. this is a more sensitive  than often portrayed. in other productions news of lady s demise hits her husband as a momentary pause in his mad rant yet blunts  appears genuinely affected by the news even as he waxes philosophical with his lines about life being a tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury signifying nothing. gordon with her billows of curls and sinewy passion as both a witch and lady  she also changes costume to be one of the killers a soldier lady  and possibly others nearly steals the show. when s murder is discovered her face is a mixture of fear and guilt as she visibly twitches with each question her husband is asked until the point she credibly swoons. the director wisely employs gordons mellifluous pipes during the play as well as in the warm up. guests at the s table cajole her into singing a song before the dinner begins and both the onstage and offstage audiences are richer for it. the costumes almost all forest tones are mostly tunics and short pants tucked into boots but combs adds thoughtful touches to signify when an actor is switching character. these minimal touches not only help the audience understand whos who but must make rapid character changes easier fighting lords add chainmail in the form of silvery infinity scarves to their basic costume while the witches slip on white garments and animal headgear a viper helmet antlers and a fox mask. the one exception to this simplicity is combs costume for gordon. lady  wears a flowing translucent gown of burnt orange that shows lots of leg and a light brown furry vest over it. in what seems a show of excess in this paired down production and also underscores her importance lady  also dons a periwinkle robe for the night scenes. winkfield is a standout in the way she moves seamlessly from one character to the next. at one point she must be both a witch and  in the same scene. she slips backstage and her witch signifiers are quickly donned by vinny mraz the chameleon of the cast while she faces the witches as the skeptical  at the side of . one can hardly look away from her when shes s ghost covered with blood stumbling and spitting like a zombie and rolling her eyes into her head until only the whites show. mraz plays the hilariously drunk porter who tries to drink with the audience a pesky boy  the regal murder victim king  and others but hes also the designer behind the single set piece in the performance. occupying a footprint of perhaps 12 by 14 feet the wooden structure provides a balcony height deck two sloped ramps a below deck hatch and a central circle shaped doorway. covered with a cloth the doorway becomes a portal to the supernatural its wooden cover becomes a whirling prop for the witches and a table top for banquets. mraz must have spent the entire off season dreaming up this structure. director bradford uses the structure to its best advantage by employing at least six exits and entrance points. the varied heights allow the audience to see  write a letter at ground level while his wife reads the same letter on the second floor its a beautiful piece of stage craft as they trade lines back and forth to read aloud the letter laying out s bloody intention to ascend to the throne. bradford is just as skilled an architect and a darn good substitute madduff in the way he has cut the text to end before dusk. for instance scenes involving lady madduffs farewell to her husband and her subsequent murder are melded into a single pantomime. not a line is spoken but you get the picture. it would be unfair to mention only five of the six actors. all are worthy of praise no matter how much limelight each enjoys. we are introduced to augustine nguyen in the pre show playing the guitar and singing a memorable rendition of witchy woman. his fox faced witch and the comic doctor evaluating lady  are just as memorable as are his many roles. purists might take issue with shake on the lakes adaptations to the bards text but no one can argue with how engaging this style of performance is. i cant help envisioning a band of players including   performing his plays exactly this way more than 400 years ago. audience members leave sorry that its over. until next summer.,5,Tragedy,Positive
Macbeth,Lean and Mean Macbeth at Misfit Theater,Ginny Quaney,due to their lack of funding and existing publicity infrastructure small companies productions of  tend to be lean mean and risky. misfit theater company is a small new company in the boulder area and no exception. first of all the venue of misfits  is deviant spirits distillery. the bar takes up an entire side of the small in the round black box stage and the six or seven lucky audience members who sit there end up literally in the middle of the action as the witches apparitions appear and  performs one of her soliloquies upon the bar. and of course before the show and during a short intermission audience members are encouraged to buy from a series of themed drinks. i chose the lady m a delicious and apropos blood orange old fashioned. the remainder of the set   so minimal that no set designer is credited   consists of boxes for standing or sitting upon and one clever upside down and below lit box on wheels for the witches cauldron. kenzie kilroys simple lighting creatively supplements the distillerys built in electrical system with string lights along the ceiling made to look like trees evoking strong images of birnam wood and backlights provided by an updated old theatre classic the cell phone flashlight. debe hultgrens main concept for this production of  is that the cast   and by extension all the characters   are all female and non binary. but a secondary concept has an arguably larger effect on the show as a whole presented almost in passing as a no intermission warning to the audience the show is cut to be only 90 minutes long. so perhaps a more accurate description would be  abridged an all female and non binary production of s shortest tragedy. the impressively short length works for the most part. s descent from brave and honorable thane to murderous traitor and tyrant is brought into disturbing relief when everything seems to rapidly spiral out of control. her and her wifes ambition proves to be truly insanity inducing as she plummets from nervously hesitating to murder  to personally slaughtering all of s pretty ones a bold choice for a show infamous for its villainous female and a production that made its ambitious man into an ambitious woman. the only minor downsides to such a short performance are the scenes left on the cutting room floor   like the famous porter scene which is fun but ultimately unnecessary for the plot   and the audiences desire in the later acts to sit and stew in some of s atrocities rather than zooming onward to the climax. the costumes designed and provided by debra ordway and theatrical costumes etc. located in boulder highlight the spectrum of gender and femininity shown by the all female and non binary cast.  a woman good enough with a dagger to impress king  the title of king here being gender neutral wears pleather pants with a long regency ish military esque jacket until after  is murdered then she wears a floor length open jacket robe as king. lady  is far more feminine always in dresses as is lady  while the remainder of the cast wears leggings with corset or vest type tops. none of the costumes is revealing however which is a relief even if expected from a female director. but the true strength of the show lies in its actors. heather lacys  only once wavers in her determination and that is just before s murder her initial interaction with the witches is one of barely contained glee and lust for power and once she has committed herself to her bloody task she never looks back in truth lacy portrays  as just as ruthless and occasionally moreso as when she personally murders the s as any man. s relationship with lady  emily tuckman is a beautiful and sympathetic picture of two women in love   both s are equal in their relationship and there is no doubt that they were made for each other as lady  can read her wifes bloody ambitions on her face before even a line of their first scene together is spoken. this is no evil woman pushing her weak husband toward regicide these women decide separately what they want only to discover that their wife wants the same bloody thing. and lacy and tuckman have on stage chemistry with both each other and the text every one of their scenes together feels as modern as if it were written yesterday. tara spires is wonderful as  too often the role of the ill fated king is given to a weaker actor to the detriment of the entire first act. spiress  however is an honorable woman who completely trusts her good friends the s which makes their betrayal all the more heartbreaking. rhianna devriess  whose pronouns like their actors are theythem throughout the text including being referred to as a parent rather than a father clearly loves scotland but not as much as their wife and children the deaths of whom send them into a heartbreaking rage eagerly encouraged by a too smiling almost creepy in the best way  madelyn smith. lady  a small but difficult role is powerfully and poignantly portrayed by miranda byers and of course no production of  would be complete without the witches beautifully performed by devries kilroy double dipping as actor and lighting designer and liz kirchmeier. here the witches truly are otherworldly as  declares as well as animalistic. they approach  and  like predators stalking and clicking and hissing at their prey. the pacing of their rhyming chants is quick and lively giving s text the musicality it deserves while also leaving the audience with the impression that these three often meet in thunder lightning or in rain. that idea is underscored by their circling and stalking of  during her final monologue only for the three to repeat their opening lines as if the cycle of tyranny in scotland has only just begun again. in the end hultgren proves whats true about small theatre companies   that sometimes the best unique  can be found with just a few actors some boxes and simple costumes in hole in the wall distillery.,4,Tragedy,Positive
Macbeth,Hedgerow Theatre’s Speedy and Spooky Macbeth,Jennifer Kramer,after offering it in repertory as part of their outreach and touring program the professional acting fellows of the hedgerow theatre bring their tightly edited production of  to the masses for a weekend of supernatural spectacle. the play has an atmospheric if ambiguous setting. chris j. kleckners set design is based entirely around a private library packed with piles of books and shelves of s. the collections of old volumes and antiques gives it a timeless quality and more than a little hint of haunted house. costume designer michael mcinerney meanwhile takes an unexpected left turn with his use of tartan providing it in the form of catholic school uniform kilts complete with coordinating polo shirts for the women. the men however wear variations on formal military dress offering no sartorial clues to the plays setting or even its underlying aesthetic. the company of six actors does an excellent job juggling both major and minor roles handling the streamlined action with a deft touch. thane madsen and melody ladd have excellent chemistry as  and lady  beginning the play with a mutual enthusiasm and youthful energy that steadily spins out of control. ladd initially portrays lady  as the more bloodthirsty of the couple then develops her growing sense of anxiety and desperation as their body count increases without ever solidifying their position. madsen meanwhile emphasizes s relationships at the beginning of the play to show how badly he is affected when they fall apart   not just his bluff and affectionate friendship with  michael mcinerney that he deliberately destroys but also his passionate marriage to his wife that deteriorates as his madness escalates. ladd joanna bak and lize meisenzahl are perfectly in sync as the three witches both literally and metaphorically trading off lines in perfect rhythm chanting creepily in unison and coordinating their movements like a macabre dance. the other actors also support this otherworldly aesthetic like mcinerney showing the ed contrast behind the affably alive  and his uncanny ghost completely impassive as he ominously toasts . director amanda coffin emphasizes the plays supernatural elements leading to some dazzling set pieces with perfectly timed and  executed special effects. however this occasionally backfires as when the apparitions in act iv scene 1 menace  by projecting onto the curtains bright and cheerfully color saturated visions with all the menace of a stock photo archive or when the production introduces atmospheric notes that never resolve into a clear theme. at the beginning of the play the actors mill about the set as unknown characters socializing with each other only to be interrupted with air raid sirens the most modern piece of technology in the production which are never heard from again the actresses then don the cloaks of the three witches as meisenzahl picks up the crown which stays on her head as she later transitions into the role of . this introduction suggests themes of transformation and an innate magic if not actual innate evil lurking behind seemingly ordinary characters   but none of this recurs in the production. similarly during lady s exhortation to the spirits in act i scene 5 she lights a ritual candle and throws back the carpet revealing a satanic looking symbol on the floorboards. apart from  later addressing the concealing carpet as he debates regicide this detail is never referred to again   a us choice given the witches and spirits summoned in the same environment later on. however the productions high points more than make up for the occasional baffling detail. pre recorded music is sparingly but effectively used invigorating scene changes with modern instrumentals incorporating scottish influences and moody sound effects. the only potential misstep is the riff on karl jenkins palladio which while appropriately atmospheric could be detrimental to an immersive experience with its inescapable association that the audience should go buy some diamond jewelry from debeers. coffins sound design gives the expected sound cues   the cry of an owl knocking without   an unnerving edge using repetition and reverb to blur the line between natural and supernatural. jared reeds lighting design meanwhile makes excellent use of the contrast between the two. a well lit scene will carry on while the backdrop   the centuries old stone walls of the hedgerows original mill   is flooded with uncanny red or purple light the characters carry flashlights that do little to illuminate the darkness a paranormal lightning storm will abruptly end in bright cheery lighting as if it never happened at all. coffin has also done an excellent job streamlining the play trimming it down to a tight 80 minutes without sacrificing any major plots or speeches. minor characters are combined eliminated or turned into a chorus creating a dream like or nightmare like state where speeches are diffused among the whole company. the pacing is quickfire without being rushed matching the energy of the actors and creating a setting where the spectacle of the special effects enhances the tension. the result is a highly enjoyable production well suited to the ethos of the hedgerow theatre combining a historical classic with modern technology and staging. their production of  is a tribute to both the timelessness of  and the creativity and ingenuity of the modern cast and crew.,5,Tragedy,Positive
Macbeth,Miscreant’s ‘Muppet Babies’ Macbeth is Ambitious Choice of Debut,Ginny Quaney,at first  may seem like an odd and dare i say ambitious choice for the debut production of a new community theatre company. then again perhaps thats what makes it perfect for denvers new miscreant theatre collective. after all s plays are timeless and were in fact wildly popular in americas west during the 19th century. they are also royalty free appealing to small companies for obvious reasons open to numerous interpretations and historically performed with casts diverse in both size and makeup. and as the lady  herself says about failure we fail but screw your courage to the sticking place and well not fail. and screw their courage to the sticking place miscreant has. the conceit of director and sound designer erin slimaks production of  a very serious play is unique timely and can perhaps be best described as  meets muppet babies. if that sounds bizarre it is. but unlike many off the wall interpretations of  it works. the show is set in a playroom of sorts and all the actors wear pajamas and play with toys. one half expects nanny visible only from the waist down as usual to enter and scold kermit  lady piggy and the great gonz quo to go to sleep which given the play theyre playacting seems apropos and given sleep and sleeplessness are major motifs in . after all  is killed in his sleep both s find themselves unable to sleep at various points throughout the play    envies  who after lifes fitful fever sleeps well and lady  famously sleepwalks while cursing out damned spot and continually washing her hands. and of course while doing the deed  hears a voice cry sleep no more  does murder sleep the innocent sleep. to this sleepless end the set props and costumes all contribute the use of common modern household clothes objects and toys another financial boon to a small new theatre company. the set flanked on two sides by the audience makes good use of the bakery a black box often used by local companies. scenic designer and technical director amy bowman creates a perfectly rendered playroom slash clubhouse from items all kids have played with at one point   empty boxes stacked into an arch topped with a sign that declares kids only at one side of the stage. a bookshelf containing a few books with their fellows strewn about makes up the other side and an old wooden toy box becomes a clever holder of various props. it naturally follows that all the props are items children would have access to and kudos to props designer and manager natalie fuentes for gathering such a diffuse collection of items. plastic swords and large lawn decorating candy canes become weapons in the final battle  carries a mace made from a wiffle bat with three teddy bears stuck around the end which may also be the work of weapons designer and miscreant founder  rodgers. kazoos and recorders playing the infamous hot cross buns hilariously become trumpets announcing the kings witches are played by a single actor who carries a spider puppet on each hand with a secondary actor in black playing with a spider marionette the branches of birnam wood are miniature fake christmas trees used to ominous and suffocating effect by s army   who step forward to take up more than half the stage as  learns of the witches prophecy come true. even the three apparitions that speak the prophecies are toys voiced by actors   the first two are a nutcracker and creepy chuckie like doll with high pitched voices while the final is a dark haired deep voiced barbie wearing a crown and holding yes an even mini er christmas tree when speaking of birnam wood coming to dunsinane. compiled by the cast and donations from act englewood the costumes are the exact sort of haphazard collection of clothes we all wore to bed as children   mismatched flannels comfy patterned pants slippers and silly socks poofy sweaters even the occasional childs sport or character watch. in keeping with the theme the actors for the major roles each carry a signifying beloved toy    plays with a yo yo  hugs a blanket and a sort of pocket watch on a chain while the s carry stuffed bears. the bears seem to be a favorite of the couple   adorned with their bear stickered paper burger king esque crowns   while their bears receive and wear matching crowns of their very own. the sound design also slimak with song adaptations composed by dillon mcdonald reflects the theme. between scenes creepy versions of childrens songs like row row row your boat are played live by actors on a toy upright piano. when the play takes a turn for the brutal at least one song is played in either a minor key or completely off key which of the two wasnt clear but either way the chilling effect is the same. the idea of course is that while these children are playing war they are also still very much children. actors hiss arguments over props or spots on the stage and many many improvised lines are not only in modern but youthful language. a lord exclaims whoa when  is promoted to thane of cawdor a messenger whispers whats that? when the title of prince of cumberland is bestowed upon  and cheers of that was awesome and did you see that? accompany over the top death scenes during earlier battles. this gives already comedic scenes another dimension such as when the porter the hilarious thomas gerlick giggles while making lewd jokes or the murderers take on personas of a pseudo vampire complete with cape and odd accent jc maheu and a new jersey mobster gerlick again even funnier. the three witches are beautifully voiced by the truly excellent eighth grader sam charney. he wears long hair and robes and presents as female and while his individual spider witch voices are not entirely distinct from each other his performance is excellent signalling the beginning of great things for the theatre major at denver school of the arts a 6th 12th magnet school. as the witches he conducts a truly inspired troupe of s descendants consisting of actors wearing crowns and occasionally patterned bedsheets with eyeholes in them a la charlie brown in the great pumpkin. which isnt to say the entire show is played off as comedy. its true that several scenes play more to the comedic side than likely originally intended   the banquet where the ghost of  the excellent amy fuhrman appears wearing a halo to a  ignoring his guests feasting on yes apple juice and fruit snacks. but as the play is written to grow more serious as it goes so do the children begin to take things more seriously. kennedi skyes  evolves smoothly and convincingly from a reluctant committer of regicide to a man in way over his head then to an utter tyrant who barely hesitates to order the murder of his best friend and perceived enemys wife and children and finally to an old soldier with nothing left to lose but his head. her performance of the famous tomorrow soliloquy is top notch and affecting. lady  played by a pig tailed giggly harley glenn follows a similar arc. it is clear that the titular couple not only love each other but truly support each other in their endeavor to the point that when one is faltering the other takes up the burden and vice versa. seeing lady  recoil in actual tears and kudos to glenn for that from her husband as he rants about his need to remove  from the equation is a breath of fresh air. glenn gives the impression that the oft portrayed evil and heartless lady is wondering who are you and what have i unleashed? the horrifically brutal murder of the  family in which a very pregnant lady  the fantastic and standout triple duty  and prop designermanager natalie fuentes gains the upper hand against a murderer only to forgo it and beg the other murderer not to kill her son it doesnt work of course and the poor babys neck is broken as the first murderer comes from behind to slice open her pregnant belly. she screams literal ribbons of blood streaming behind her as she crawls offstage. fuentess lovely grief over her fathers death as  earlier in the play is only a taste of what she fully gives here which is an utterly heartbreaking performance of an abandoned wife and mother who fights like a lioness to protect her babies only to completely and tragically fail. the following scene also stars fuentes having quick changed into  which creates a fascinating juxtaposition of s priorities leaving the audience to judge whether or not they are in the correct order. this scene as its predecessor is brutal but emotionally rather than violently   doron burkss  is destroyed by the news of his familys death signified symbolically by the breaking of his beloved yo yo. his performance grows more and more unhinged until he engages in a bloodless but viciously violent fight well choreographed by triple dipper rodgers.  snaps s neck in a tragic and sickening parallel to the death of his son and it isnt exactly a spoiler given the headless bear on the posters and the honest to goodness raffle for the head of the tyrant when he impressively and barbarically rips off the head of s becrowned stuffed bear. if the on stage deaths of actual children dont symbolize the end of childhood then the decapitation of an adorable teddy bear certainly does. all part of slimaks intention as she addresses the state of politics in the directors notes the people in charge of our government act upon a childlike platform with an even more juvenile demeanor. its almost like a bunch of children are playing at how to run the world. if at first it seems odd that a new small community theatre on a shoestring budget could produce such a relevant unique and compelling interpretation of s literally most ambitious play it shouldnt. s plays are as accessible as they are after 400 years exactly because   started out the same way   a poor writer and a small group of his actor friends scraping by until they could get noticed by someone important. and in that sense miscreants  is truly  as its meant to be done.,4,Tragedy,Positive
Macbeth,Pause from Contemporary Reference in Great Lakes' Macbeth,Yuko Kurahashi,although it is intriguing to see a production of  set in a contemporary time and place it is also refreshing to see his work performed in a traditional style like the recent production at the great lakes theater. in the program notes director  fee elaborates on his choice with both  and  we have taken a pause from contemporary reference no cell phones video screens or contemporary music. fee and scenic designer russell metheny recreated s globe by converting the upstage area of the stage into galleries for some of the audience to sit and balconies for actors to use. the rest of the thrust stage serves as the main performing area. this stage configuration is the same as in their 2017 production of . metheny placed an additional low platform in centerstage to suggest various objects and spaces such as the banquet table and woods. at the beginning two sets of electric chandeliers are raised intensifying the feeling of an elizabethan stage. lighting designer rick martin complements this bare stage by varying the intensity texture and focus of the lighting. the simplicity of this staging enables the actors to focus on the plays language and the psychology of their characters and their relationships. lynn robert bergs  is a man consumed by ambition fear and uncertainty. for example in his soliloquy berg addresses his plan to assassinate king  david  smith to an invisible dagger undersg his unstable state of mind. erin partins lady  is a woman who has been hardened by the loss of her newborn and is determined to improve her prospects by making her husband king. thus when she sees her husband disoriented by the ghost of  and her ambitions thwarted she begins to deteriorate. jonathan dyrud  contrasts with bergs old and hard  by portraying him as a younger and likable man. he shows affection to his young son  played by jake spencer. in act ii scene 1 in the courtyard of s castle  wakes up  and entrusts his sword and dagger to him enjoying a respite and fatherhood. this scene also fulfills one of the witches prophesies  will be king. laura welsh berg jodi dominick and meredith lark play mysterious witches with long hair. their costumes with extended arms using sticks in the sleeves of their black feather cloaks allow them to appear to transform into trees and bats. their appearance along with choreographed movements suggest the power to fly any place including the banquet hall. though fees fast paced direction is appropriate to this play it does cause some subtler implications to be missed. for example this production does not provide enough time to contrast the well equipped and energized forces of  with s isolation and desperation without enough soldiers and equipment in the castle of dunsinane. while kim krumm sorensons costumes suggest a medieval scotland they lack specific ers for example tartan colors that might have helped the audience to distinguish the affiliations of the soldiers in the opening battle scene. however lady s rich textured costumes in dark brown and purple suggest not only her state of mind but also the coldness of s primitive castle. the conflicts explored in s  do not end at the end of the play instead the ending evokes the continuing struggles and bloodshed over the crown in s history plays. the abrupt blackout that fee chose for the end of the show suggests the short reign of the new king  and the dark times ahead.,4,Tragedy,Positive
Macbeth,A Delightfully Terrifying Production of Macbeth,Benjamin Alper,it is fitting that the atlanta  company started their run of  on the night of the harvest moon. this delightfully terrifying production of the scottish play is the perfect way to start the fall season. as one of s most famous plays  can be both foul and fair to its director. given that most people are already familiar with the plot of the play  is therefore more accessible to the general viewing public. however since everyone already knows what is supposed to happen a director must rely on the strength of the actors and must also utilize effective lighting sound and staging techniques to keep the audience engaged. veteran director jeff watkins combines all of these elements masterfully in this produce and delivers a thrilling theater experience. the actors are phenomenal. matt nitchie and dani heard fresh off of their great performances as  and katherina in the taming of the shrew have great chemistry as  and lady . they play off one another beautifully and the physical transformation that both undergo as their characters delve deeper and deeper into madness is striking. the strong performances of these actors almost overshadows the other great performances by the rest of the cast. in the second half of the play kenneth wigley and troy willis give truly excellent performances as  and  and yet the whole time i was watching them i was anxious to get back to more  and lady  scenes. j. tony brown is also highly entertaining and shows his range as he transitions from playing  to playing the porter and several other characters with an ease that does not cause the audience any distraction. while  and lady  obviously drive the action of the play the way a director chooses to interpret and display the weird sisters can make or break a production of . as the first characters to appear on stage the weird sisters set the tone for the entire play. any time you are dealing with the supernatural you run the risk of the performance coming off as silly and distracting from the overall dark nature of the play especially when performed around halloween when there are cartoon witches everywhere you look. the last thing you want is people laughing at something that is supposed to be chilling. it is also difficult because the scenes with the weird sister are so famous that it is hard to frighten an audience when they have seen this all before. but through the effective use of lighting sound effects staging and wonderful acting by rivka levin tatyana arrington and kathryn lawson as the sisters watkins manages to take some of s most famous scenes and still make them truly terrifying. the interesting use of puppets yes puppets as the apparitions in the double double toil and trouble scene is downright disturbing which i am sure is exactly what the director was going for. sound effects and creative lighting are used throughout the course of the play to place the audience in a world where everything is just slightly off. these effects are most fully utilized with great success during the banquet scene with s ghost but they appear throughout the play and help highlight the s collective descent into darkness. blood is such a central theme in this play that it is impossible for a production of  to not be bloody but this production abstains from the tendency of other recent productions of  to literally bathe their actors in blood throughout the play. again this choice to embrace the disturbing nature of the play without having the production descend into the comical is appreciated.  is so well known that it is fashionable as it is with many other of s most famous works to change the setting time period or perspective of the play to draw the audience in. while if this is done well it can enhance the viewers experience such stunts can often come across as gimmicky attempts to put fresh paint on a classic structure. however since the atlanta  company performing at the  tavern playhouse focuses solely on performances that attempt to capture how a play was originally performed it must rely on great acting great directing and a great text to thrill an audience. this most recent production of  has all three going for it and is a reminder that  in the hands of a great company is all you need to have an enjoyable and frightening time.,4,Tragedy,Positive
Macbeth,"Raw, Primitive Macbeth is Ambitious, Intense, and Excellent",Ginny Quaney,the freedom that comes with producing four century old  can be both a gift and a curse. the lack of anything but the simplest stage directions allows for infinite interpretations settings and conceits   a gender swapped comedy of errors set in 1920s  loves labors lost as a classic 1930s musical troilus and cressida in a post apocalyptic hellscape     in modern day verona beach. but such freedom includes risk. the more bizarre the interpretation the more difficulty in selling the conceit and many ambitious productions even those with intriguing ideas can fall flat. the denver performing arts center theatre companys  is one of those rarer productions completely successful in its ambitious interpretation. director robert oharas primitively dark and magical all male production was inspired by s act i scene 3 line you should be women and yet your beards forbid me to interpret that you are so. the idea that the witches might not be women at all but men led to the productions main conceit   a group of warlocks the all male cast descendants of the original witches perform a pagan ritual in which they summon the performance as a sort of morality play. if that sounds outrageous thats because it is. but ohara his cast and his set light sound and costume designers make it work. the world hes created is raw and controversial evidenced by the age recommendation high school  and lengthy advisory including warnings for stylized violence minimal costuming including exposed skin some sexual content pulsating music foghaze strobe lights loud noises and e cigarettes. as disturbing as that all may sound listed out it works for a show in which the main character brutally racks up a long list of victims including young children. while most of the violence is stylized   arms become swords and even daggers in the is that a dagger i see before me? scene   s death is bloody even as the two daggers  wields never come within a foot of him. but if this production proves anything its that cold blooded murder is more than disturbing enough on its own. the all male cast creates clear lgbtq  undertones and overtones providing both excellent reality and representation. the two husband wife relationships the s and the s become relationships between two male actors the s even have a steamy stylized sex scene when he returns from battle. lady  has an affair with an ambiguously gendered servant and  and  have an interesting heavily implied while alive overt after murder sexual relationship that points to a deeper connection than is obvious in the text. such relationships contrast nicely with the overt themes of toxic masculinity both in the text and this particular interpretation. the ambiance of debauchery of  and his entourage drugs and alcohol and perhaps an implied orgy? prior to the kings final night at castle  tell us these are not innocent or admirable royals which brings lady s unsex me here speech into nice relief. why wouldnt she question her husbands masculinity and wish to be a man herself when thats all that seems to matter in this world? dede m. ayites costume designs play with gender roles as much as the casting does. androgyny is the name of the game here for most of the actors many of whom wear their long hair down. the warlocks wear black speedos black boots or sandals and black sm esque tops that barely cover anything resulting in what must be a record setting amount of stage time featuring half naked men in a  production. as the various characters are summoned they are dressed in a bizarre mashup of warlock uniform and classic elizabethan garb. thus  the superb ariel shafir wears an elizabethan collar and pumpkin pants knee high boots a top vaguely invoking the idea of armor and leather wristlets with bare arms and legs.  gareth saxe seeming to channel a strip club version of hamiltons king george iii wears a speedo crown kingly robe and nothing else. lady   poss is dressed by the warlocks in a corset and medieval looking short skirt frame covered in the back by a long skirt but showing her bare clearly masculine legs in the front. later when she is crowned queen she dons a fancier but matching robe with impressions of sleeves and a high collar a beautifully powerful image of queen e herself. the set lighting and sound design all work so seamlessly together its almost impossible to discuss them separately. the space theater was designed in 1985 to resemble the old globe theatre and was remodeled just this year in fact  s its grand re opening. its pentagonal shape creates an intimate in the round stage that works so well for the simultaneously ancient and timeless pagan ritual setting that its difficult to tell where the stage ends and jason sherwoods set design begins. the stage floor is a giant summoning circle covered in symbols from dozens of languages and times   or rather three concentric summoning circles which rotate independently of each other. the middle circle is a platform that can rise to become s deathbed or the s table or sink to become a cauldron for the warlocks double double toil and trouble chant. at one point a character descends from the ceiling on a small yes pentagonal platform. there are also a few temporary set pieces rolled onto the floor by the cast themselves like the castle cutouts which surround the partying royal entourage as it commits its debauchery. alex jainchills lighting design is so well integrated into the set it seems to be a part of it. because there are no permanent set pieces besides the platforms the lighting creates much of the implied scenery. the stage is bathed in green when triangular scaffolding invoking birnam wood rolls from each of the five aisles to form a starpentagram filling the entire stage. and during the most unsettling scene when the entire cast of warlocks joined by e chant and dance a primitive magical rite around a bonfire the smoke and lighting combine with a set piece of stacked wood to produce a disturbingly realistic fire. but the set and lighting effects wouldnt be nearly as effective without the sound design of lindsay jones. the sounds alone would be creepy enough   when the drunk porter rants about hell the audience hears flames and other eerie sound effects when battles rage the sounds of swords ring out and when  hears whispers so do we. but its the music that truly brings the whole raw intense primitive production together. some if not all of the aggressive trap music is original composed by jones. it is loud uncomfortable intense and at times even bad ass   the musical entrance of  and lady  as king and queen in particular with lady m in full queen elizabeth garb nailed the sense of triumph for the s and foreboding for everyone else. while the entire cast is excellent   its never easy to double  or even triple up roles much less in such a physical production   ariel shafir as  shines. his delivery of the 400 year old text manages to sound more modern than some contemporary dialogue. he brings out the humanity in  through his humor never let anyone tell you  the show or the character isnt funny fear and guilt but not so much that the audience doesnt root for his eventual defeat. shafirs chemistry with  posss lady  also serves to humanize him   their interactions are so natural and again modern that the audience laughed during some of the most serious scenes of the show. posss question and subsequent exasperation when questioning  about why he didnt leave the daggers at the scene of the crime and shafirs annoyed response feel as though they are bickering about a grocery list and not murder. which isnt to say that the actors dont nail the serious moments as well. poss creates a powerful and terrifying lady  and shafir successfully conveys s turn from initial doubts to the seeming ease with which he orders and sometimes commits the atrocities that follow. there is never any doubt that they are both villains. oharas direction leads to edits to the text that are unusual in contemporary productions. the scenes with e for instance which are usually cut for time and because their provenance is questionable not only work with the central conceit but add to it. and someone did their mythological homework because e a triune goddess is played by three different actors who either split her lines or speak as one. while the immense fight and other choreography is credited in the program to the entire ensemble the idea of an eerie danse macabre of daggers arms wearing white opera gloves which glow blue in the black light as  contemplates regicide must have originated with ohara. the production is full of choices like that   s murders are made more personal because of the specific actorscharacters chosen to double as the murderers. the warlocks raise  from the dead to haunt  like a zombie ghost hybrid. lady  gets a beautifully choreographed fight scene which makes her eventual defeat that much more upsetting. and during the final fight between  and  the warlocks use magic to manipulate time and space so that s death is particularly vengeful and satisfying. such an ambitious production could easily have failed spectacularly if any one of its massive moving parts   directing casting choreography stage set lighting sound   had been weak. its success is a feat unto itself. even more impressive however is the fact that such an ambitious production provides more than just a gimmick but a truly new take on a centuries old play. emotionally this production takes a toll. at intermission i sat stunned for several minutes unable to pull myself out of the intensity of the show and when i attempted to write a few notes about my thoughts all i had were a series of interjections and adjectives wow. intense. bizarre. metal. creepy. raw. wow. as i left the theater after the show my body ached with a tension i hadnt noticed until it was gone. thats what good theatre should do. thats what good  should do. the exquisite discomfort of dcpas  is perfect for the story of one of s greatest villains. this production will stick with me for a very long time and in theatre theres no higher compliment than that.,5,Tragedy,Positive
Macbeth,The Scottish King and the CIA,Yuko Kurahashi,one of the pleasures of attending different productions of  is to see how the director has discovered different meanings in the bards text and presents them. the  theatre company production of  directed by liesl tommy created an exquisite transformative work through historicization gender bending and scenography. the locale of this production is an unspecified war torn country in africa with head scarves and bright african garments for the women designed by kathleen geldard and multiracial casting. prior to the scene of  queen  in this production performed by petronia paley and her children her son  played by cory allen and  in this production her daughter played by nicole king tommy adds a scene that shows the villagers fleeing from soldiers. at the end of this scene a soldier with the help of another fakes a wound. it is this soldier that reports s valor to  making s heroism questionable. tommy sets the play in the context of american involvement in post colonial nations. the three witches performed by tim getman david bishins and naomi jacobson are western intelligent agents who manipulate . at the stage right wing of the sidney harman halls proscenium stage is a computer console suggesting their headquarters. field agents observe and report to the intelligent headquarters the murder of  carried out by child soldiers played by brayden simpson and anu yadav recruited by . the murder of lady  and her children is carried out by the same assassins. under tommys direction words are given new meanings to suit this context. for example s second meeting with the witches in a heath is set in s clandestine meeting with the intelligent chief e played by stephen elrod and the three agents. on a screen they show a series of images including a burning building as they recite double double toil and trouble fire burn and cauldron bubble act iv scene i.  blindfolded is brought in along with boxes of cocaine and guns. this scene ends with  after being questioned by e snorting cocaine. s choice of cocaine over guns explains why s army is easily overpowered by the joint forces of  and . scene designer  coynes set consists of panels beams a chandelier and a backdrop. the metallic looking panels each iridescent fabric panel was scrunched by the scenic artists giving the impression of metal when illuminated personal interview with coyne are lowered and raised from and to the flying area evoking the desolate atmosphere of the mountains and forests. a horizontal golden crack on the backdrop suggests the schism and destructive forces in scotland. collin k. billss lighting accentuates these scenic elements. in addition to the panels a number of lighted tubes are lowered and raised into and out of the flying area. these vertical lights strips of led lights encased in a plastic tube were built to look like fluorescent lights personal interview with coyne. as they change colors in blue orange and green they serve as visually striking grids on a map while also suggesting transmission lines and wire tapping by the intelligent agency. tommys careful directing pays attention not only to the political context but also to the individual background stories circumstances psychology transitions relationships and comical interludes. the show starts with a sound effect of a baby crying suggesting the s child whom they lost before the play starts. then lady  sitting on a sofa washes down pills with a drink. this scene added by tommy is without words and foreshadows the downfall of the s. the ghost of their baby reappears in the second act  when lady  losing her mind tries to wash off imagined blood from her hands. nikkole salters lady  dramatically displays a variety of emotions including greed ambition and sorrow. tommy creates an excellent transition between the murder of  and s coronation.  and lady  arrive at dunsinane in a luxurious car as the crowd raise and lower their right hands to show their loyalty to their new leader. in this scene as well as the fight and murder scenes the music created by broken chord underscore the atmospheres.  is shown

about his plot and justification during the reception to honor queen . each time he speaks other characters freeze. perez dexterously shows a sign of physical pain embodying the conflict between his greed and fear. strong relationships between parents and children add another layer and depth to the characters. mckinley belcher iiis  shows his affection through a playful scene with his son  played by brett son. lady  pregnant in this production played by nilanjana bose expresses her love to her witty daughter played by trinity sky deabreu. deabreaus girl s eldest son in s text tries to protect her mother from the assassins kicking and scratching them before being killed. at the end of the scene the murderers put a rubber tire on and pour gasoline over lady  before dragging her off stage. this chilling image echoes many similiar incidents in civil wars in africa. tommy emphasizes one comical scene the drunken porter scene in this gruesome tragedy. myra lucretia taylor as the porter stumbles through a row of the audience before getting to the door. at the last scene after the head of  is dragged away by  the three intelligent operatives take pictures of the corpses as they prepare for their next operation. the ghosts of  lady  and other dead characters observe them. this ending suggests the prevalent cycle of violence and imperialism today. tommy is known for her direction of the broadway production of danai guriras eclipsed which won her the lucille lortel award and tony nomination for best direction of a play. an immigrant from apartheid era south africa many of her productions are set in specific times and locales inhabited by africans and african americans california  theaters  and dallas theater centers les misérables for example. she created her concept of western involvement in former colonies specifically for the dcs  company. although she states in her program notes that this is a production for a d.c. audience i believe that this is a

All's Well That Ends Well,Why No One is Talking About Fassbender’s and Cotillard’s Macbeth,Robert M. LoAlbo,when news broke that oscar nominees michael fassbender and marion cotillard would be headlining the scottish play on film with a period accurate sensibility we all celebrated that we would finally be getting a more updated look to what polanski successfully did years ago. when the trailer broke with now over three and a half million views we cheered at the seemingly exciting slow motion visceral grime and fetishistic blood splatter that this production would bring anticipating that this version would be the  that would cross scholarly boundaries reaching the uninitiated. in the interim the film perplexingly struggled to find a distributor until the weinsteins finally released it into five theaters last december with little to no fanfare. since then its languished in the on demand world for all to see yet no one did. its completely dropped out of the public consciousness word of mouth never ignited from the few who did see it and for good reason this film didnt live up to our expectations and just doesnt work. so the question remains what is so wrong with it that would make something so anticipated become such a non entity so suddenly? as the initial draw to the film we can be quick to blame the actors mostly because as a society we love to tear down our idols but in watching the central performances many of the decisions seem out of their hands. for the sake of purposeful dramatic subtlety they recite every line in a raspy murmur as actors knit their brows look overly focused and intense and speak lines a little above a whisper. the thought that maybe fassbender and cotillard were cast based on their expression filled eyes cs the viewers mind as they try to give looks that seem to speak volumes so that their mouths dont have to. for the titular character we can understand this somewhat comatose approach as some directors like to downplay s emotions for the first half of the play so that his madness can be that much more intense when it comes. for fassbender this approach mostly works. before the kings death fassbender plays  as a man on the edge manipulated by his surroundings so when he kills unprovoked its somewhat shocking as to how much his madness takes over. following this approach later scenes show him mumbling to himself glancing around paranoically and with fassbenders stature and practiced expressions we feel his horrific decent. we see him becoming introverted and withdrawn however because the opening half has him so un charismatically muted and somewhat unlikeable but for a brief sword slice from the knave to th chops we never see the great warrior and leader he is his downfall isnt as dramatic and tragic as it should be. as for lady  her opening scenes show great promise as she seduces and copulates with her husband while convincing him to kill giving cotillard a chance to display some range but beyond that moment she is pretty window dressing good looking background a wide eyed participant with nothing to contribute. yet all of these decisions dont seem to come from the leads. and its not the fault of the world thats been created either. working with a thundercloud gray and earth tone palette that later develops into oranges and yellows reminiscent of a solar flare the filmmakers create a landscape scorched by war and scarred by hatred with an opening battle reminiscent of kenneth branaghs and rob ashfords recent new york armory production. with a reliance on natural lighting the striking visuals draw the viewer into this savage world filled with murder betrayal and dirt. lots of dirt akin to a mad max remake. adding to the realism the witches are also grounded portrayed as flesh and blood with no hint of abilities beyond prophecy giving the sense that the mystical live among us and not above us. another strong contribution to the development of the world is that entrances and exits are almost never filmed initially a strange choice and are instead covered with film edits. surprising the effect is that we are then thrust into conversations already happening and the immediacy of the events is purposefully eliminated giving the film a dreamlike quality to it as one scene gently flows into the next. yet these parts do not cover up the glaringly misguided issues that remain. strip them away and the reason for the films poor reception becomes clear the blame lies with the screenwriters and the director and their ill conceived emphases and wildly wrongheaded choices in editing all of which are rooted in a basic misunderstanding of the play as evidenced by these decisions. refocusing the films dramatic themes the filmmakers decide to start with the s burying their dead child a reference that is hinted at later on in the text emphasizing how everything the couple does is overshadowed by this tragic event. although not a new idea its not an often used one so credit is given for taking some risks with refocusing the story around this event. however this emphasis seems to be the only card up the filmmakers sleeves the only new idea they bring to the table. instead of clever additions the filmmakers institute massive cuts to the screenplay left and right for fear that the viewer be distracted away from their point. what emerges is a serious imbalance between trimming the original text for the sake of said focus and developing a leaner faster paced film. the cuts are wildly haphazard with minor characters being pared down beyond their essence for the sake of this sole focus and time. blink and youll miss it lady s role is mostly reduced to screams of murder. instead of breaking new ground with the grieving s or even developing additional themes given the breathing room as a result of the cuts primogeniture vs. tanistry the coexistence of the sacred and the profane the challenges of manhood anything the time is now filled with flat emotionless drawn out line readings that take up twice as much time as they should developing a lurid pace that makes it feel even longer. the filmmakers choice to cut ancillary characters sometimes contributes to the leanness of the screenplay such as in the decision to mostly eliminate ross from the proceedings a character that speaks much but never really has much bearing on anything minus polanskis interpretation and the murderers speeches with  lots of rhetoric little reward however more often than not the elimination of said characters has detrimental effects on key scenes. for example where his much needed comic relief lightens the burden of the kings death on the audience with levity the porter is gone making this undertaking a completely mirthless affair. another is lady s sleepwalking scene where the filmmakers chose to cut the nurse and doctor completely. what highlights and draws out lady s decent into madness is the juxtaposition of these two seemingly unnecessary characters diagnostic stance with her quixotic behavior and their observations of lady s erratic actions and confessional comments. without these two her scene is turned into a glorified soliloquy filled with lament and regret instead of insanity with no one to name and label her psychosis for the audiences sake. without much thought to development and continuity whole sections are either cut or reorganized for the sake of time and focus. many lines make no sense and lose all narrative thread. when lady  says you lack the season of all natures sleep there is no evidence to support that  is sleep deprived and has in fact murdered sleep. a jumbled act 3 now alters motivations and character arcs. lady s madness is no longer attributed to her inability to cope with the mounting pile of bodies but instead is as a result of her husbands increasingly paranoid and illogical choices. for a film so concerned with developing the effect of generational loss they sure did cut quite a bit that would have contributed to the theory. s pride over young s death? lets get rid of those two.  struggling to return to his fathers homeland and embrace his rightful reign as heir? who needs that am i right? if youre going to cut there needs to be some method to it. and then there are just bafflingly dumbfounded decisions that defy logic. right after establishing the opening scenes there is an expositional dump with decidedly un an scrolling narration about the war. of the now four witches two have thuddingly obvious american accents a horribly miscast and wasted david thewlis who was it that mistook him for being regal? and the complete lack of character reactions to emotionally loaded lines making many actors look tired and bored. there are just plain weird interpretations of lines to fulfill the prophecy of birnam wood coming to dunsinane the filmmakers set fire to the trees of birnam wood and the glowing embers find their way to the castle on the wind. and finally the filmmakers commit a critically unforgiveable sin by having lady  share a brief albeit detrimental moment with the witches thereby allowing her to forfeit any and all responsibility for her actions chalking her fate up to supernatural solicitation. as so much of the audiences catharsis lies in lady  receiving a comeuppance in her madness she is now seen as a pitied victim of mystical whims. its all a frustratingly maddening business considering the talent involved that only whets our appetites for what could have been. in the hands of better artists it may have ended up being the period authentic  we all need and deserve. out out indeed.,2,Comedy,Negative
Macbeth,A Scottish King in an Asylum: The Old Globe’s Macbeth,Yuko Kurahashi,the old globe production of  directed by brian kulick artistic director of classic stage company in new york city uses the motif of a hospital and asylum in world war i to situate the title characters spur and desire for power within a context of madness. the result is an ambivalent work with a hint of  weisss maratsade leaving the audience disjointed between staging elements and the bards lines. entering the old globes lowell davies festival theatre the audience sees six hospital beds and classic wicker chairs placed in a semi circle on a round area of the theatres thrust stage. upstage is a white cyclorama with six wall lamps and one door stage right on the cyclorama. in each bed a wounded soldier lies wrapped in white bandages. director kulick uses three of the patients lunatic as well as wounded as the witches linking supernatural forces and the madness of the great war. it is into this hospital room that king  jerome preston bates enters with his sons  daniel petzold  kevin hafso koppman and a scottish thane  james joseph oneil all wearing long overcoats and caps in navy blue and black boots. demanding the poor bleeding sergeant amara james aja give a detailed report of the battle kulick has aja sit in one of the wheelchairs. a nurse translates his words which are difficult to understand because of the bandages around his face. this opening gives a clear sense of the brutality of the war. this hospitalasylum metaphor continues the entire performance and as the show progresses it becomes a major hindrance for the audience. in act 1 scene 3  jonathan cake and  timothy stickney wander into the abandoned hospital not into a heath where three lunatic patients who may exist only in the minds of  and  give a prophecy. at his castle  kills  while he sleeps in a hospital bed. in act 4 scene 1 the witches and e are portrayed as straitjacketed asylum inmates. when lady  marsha stephanie blake loses her mind she is admitted to the asylum. in act 5 the dunsinane castle court is transformed into again an asylum where cakes disheveled  lies on a bed wearing pajama pants and an overcoat over his naked upper body. he is then ready to fight using only his iv stand as a weapon. this series of recurrening asylum images make the audience to wonder if they are only watching s nightmares or hallucinations instead of the story of . the designers underscore the directors metaphors. scenic designer arnulfo maldonado makes the first hospital scene stark white cold and sterile in contrast to red used the middle of the show after the murder of  a red vinyl curtain is drawn and after the intermission the white round floor is replaced by a red one. later maldonado returns to the cool white tone after  begins to exhibit an unstable mind. costume designer oana botez captures the transformation after the coronation of . while all of the characters including  and lady  wear navy blue uniforms in the first part of the show for the top of the scene after the intermission botez chooses black tuxedos for the courtiers and  a black evening dress for lady  and slim silhouetted red dresses for the ladies at the court. the combination of black red and white suggest both the s bloody deals and the wealth and position they obtained as a result. lighting designer jason lyons keeps a cool tone for the most of the scenes but for the murder scenes he accentuates the atmosphere with disturbingly orange light. high frequency tones from sound designers sten severson and david thomas create a dissonant mood. though individually strong and experienced actors jonathan cakes  and marsha stephanie blakes ladys  didnt create a sense of chemistry between them. cake tries too hard to be charming while blake uses a single level and rhythm. she delivers all her lines in the same commanding way constantly nagging and yelling at her husband. the navy blue uniform a skirt a jacket and a cap she wears to receive her most honorable guest king  not only emphasizes her militant attitude and aura but gives an impression that she holds rank in the military. although kulick seems to try and compensate for the lack of chemistry between cake and blake by adding lovemaking to their plotting they do not seem to be a cohesive couple. kulicks strength lies in the feast scenes and the famous porter knocking scene. the feast for  takes place behind the cyclorama while servants bring bottles of wine and champagne one hears the sounds of the guests tapping tables cheering and chanting. all the while on the front of the stage  and lady  concoct their plot to murder the king. in the porter scene kulick has the porter  lavelle engaged in a sexual act with one of the gentlewomen talley beth gale thereby increasing the sexual connotations of his lines and justifying to the audience why the porter doesnt open the door right away. sadly the relationships between the characters their actions lines and props are left undeveloped. for example in act 2 scene 1 s son  ajinkya desai is sleeping in a corner of the castle when  enters to wake him up making the relationship between the two ambiguous. s line here take my sword. is mismatched with the small knife that stickneys  gives desai as . when  kills  while sleeping in bed the audience is not able to see him stubbing him. instead cake seems to be busy patting the pillows to activate fake blood. s son is portrayed by a small child size puppet and his lines are delivered by cake which complicates our interpretation of the scene. the pinnacle of the show the fight between  and  is staged with pistols and the characters lower their guns to engage in long speeches a lengthy speech in a fight scene is more believable in a sword fight where characters maneuver parry and thrust. after the death of  three gurneys with lady  young  lorenzo landini and  are wheeled onto the stage creating a postmortem atmosphere. this unfortunately does not go well with  and s lines celebrating a new beginning for scotland. in the program notes kulick states his intention to help the audience get closer to what  was after by creating an environment that is more in tune to our contemporary imagination. unfortunately clinical sterile and trench war images do not allow us to enter the story of a man who is consumed by the darkness of his soul in times of war and intrigue.,3,Tragedy,Negative
Macbeth,Blood and Thunder in the PST's Macbeth,Jennifer Kramer,2016 s the 400th anniversary of s death. it also s the 20th anniversary of the philadelphia  theatre now beginning their season with . one could easily expect some bombastic spectacle in celebration of these lands. but as director carmen khan notes in the program the play follows the slow inexorable unfolding of the consequences of [s] crime in the minds of  and his wife [ ] in the crumbling discipline of his administration [ ] in the devastation of scotland itself and the philadelphia  theatre chooses instead to showcase their talents through the subtleties and restrained chaos of the scottish play. khan cites inspiration from the paintings of  goya and francis bacon the artist not the empiricistalleged secret identity of  whose most obvious influence on the production is the atmosphere. bethanie wampols set contains some more specific nods wood panelling frames the back of the stage as it would a painting and the vertical slats of the movable wooden screen before the cyclorama recall the interesting visual distortions in bacons study after velázquezs portrait of pope innocent x among others. the cyclorama is one of the only sources of color on the set largely projecting a royal and bloody gradient of purple and red. the thrust stage and shallow stairs to the platform upstage are also made of wood and the dried fronds of some plant are bound in sheathes to the back of the screen creating a sense of barrenness and desiccation. though free from typical horror imagery the atmosphere is nonetheless uniquely unsettling. costume designer vickie esposito does a nice job with period inspired costumes evoking middle ages scotland without overdoing it on historical authenticity or plaid. in further nods to goya and bacon the witches are dressed in black and smeared in lines of charcoal and the color palette of the production as a whole is muted but not monotone. the evocative blood red of the cloaks robes and gowns of the royal family whichever one may be in power at the time stands out amongst blacks browns dark greens and slate blues. costume changes follow the fortunes of the lead couple. lady s look evolves from a dark green day dress to a similar velvet gown lined with fuchsia and trimmed with gold to an even more sumptuous red velvet dress when she becomes queen.  meanwhile seems most at ease in the relatively simple brown leather tunic and green cloak in which he begins the play his red velvet cape and flowing scarlet gown provoke visible discomfort. the technical difficulty of these frequent changes ultimately pays off. lady  sleepwalking in her nightgown is a shocking deviation from her sartorial exactitude.  returns to his simple leather tunic when he receives the prophecies of his seeming invincibility and likewise regains some of his drive and energy from the beginning of the play though both energy and outfit are ultimately a poor fit with his position as king. overall the cast is very strong if occasionally veering towards declamatory.  zaks  is an idealistic and tactile king more likely to give out hugs than orders playing up the injustice of his murder and the contrast with s reign of terror. as the son of  jenna kuerzi manages to pull off precocious without being precious. elise hudson julia jensen ray and sarah stryker as the witches deliver an excellent tripartite performance one that never goes over the top despite the hissing cackling and vomiting of blood. their movements are always in sync whether recoiling from s i th name of truth or struggling to hold up their staves as if the weight of their magic is bearing them down. the staging of the prophecy scene is genuinely creepy as the three engage in a little light pyrotechnics before stryker eyes unblinking and head canted at an unnatural angle acts as the visions mouthpiece. annabel capper offers an interesting interpretation of lady  one who is always moving quivering with nerves and excitement whether contemplating the couples elevation or reaching out to futilely soothe her husband or clutching her goblet half extended in a toast as she tries to reassure their party guests. the other characters rarely seem to  her nerviness and her swoon when s murder is discovered seems entirely genuine further reinforcing the impression that her high strung nature is well known. however this does backfire somewhat as the play progresses it becomes difficult to tell how much lady s condition has deteriorated as capper maintains a level of nervous energy throughout. rob kahns  initially appears to balance his wifes high tension with a calm steadiness. however kahn subtly introduces a number of cracks in s facade at all stages of his journey. when  begins to name his heir  begins to step confidently forward only to falter wrong footed when the king makes  the prince of cumberland his confidence is revealed to be in part entitlement and kahn shows the sting of its loss and s discomposure at being thwarted in an ambition he had only just learned about. after  has fulfilled his ambition and become king kahn makes it clear the position never sits easily on s shoulders he seldom meets peoples eyes anxiously bats at the folds of his heavy cloak and robe and compulsively rubs his wifes hands an ostensible gesture of comfort that inevitably recalls their bloody deed. after his breakdown in the banquet scene where kahn does fine work reacting only to an empty chair even glancing nervously back as he exits the stage  seems to regain some of his assurance when he visits the witches and learns of his apparent invincibility. however kahn clearly shows that this energy is destructive inside and out.  hurtles towards the plays conclusion laughing evilly and taunting his foes of woman born at the cost of being unable to mourn his wife and striking terror in his own people. when he finally confronts  kahn shows s realization that his confidence was in error and his final fight is fueled only by stubbornness and the dying remains of his momentum. director carmen khan skillfully guides this evolution playing out the contrast between the gracious  and that tyrant . she shows a similar skill with the productions use of violence and the supernatural as carefully deployed as her references to goya and bacon. gore is frequent but not overdone s appearance after s murder is dramatically sprayed with blood but all subsequent callbacks bloody knives a witch regurgitating blood into their cauldron a wound in the shape of the blood spatter on s head are deliberately restrained. meanwhile khan simultaneously plays up and plays down the plays supernatural elements. there are many sound effects the shriek of night birds warning buzz of rattlesnakes appropriately timed rolls of thunder and distant screaming all courtesy of composersound designer  obispo but few visuals none of the visions appear onstage so while the audience can hear the ominous events described through voice and noise they must focus on the reactions of the actors. the result is a production that feels traditional without sacrificing a sense of excitement or the adrenaline of horror. the philadelphia  theatres production of  relies on the strength of s stagecraft to showcase their ingenuity and talent a worthy celebration of their years of accomplishments as well as an encouraging prophecy of productions to come.,4,Tragedy,Positive
Macbeth,Everyone's a Badass,Kurt Daw,in kristen brandts production of  scotlands aristocratic class of thanes is composed equally of hulking men straight out of braveheart and badass broadsword wielding warrior women. this is far from the only way that actresses are especially prominent in santa cruz s current offering but it is the most viscerally startling. particularly the magnificent greta wohlrabes  absolutely gendered female without having to become banqua  is unforgettable from her first bloody appearance.  princess of cumberland played by sierra jolene and the thane of ross played by patty gallagher offer more variations on the theme as do several ensemble players but even in their less fierce portraits we are closer to mad max or an episode of vikings than the typical scottish setting. focusing us on women immediately the play opens with an interpolated scene in which the three weird sisters are arrested and accused of collecting body parts from the battlefield for the purposes of witchcraft. this seems to place us in the medieval past but visually b. moderns leather heavy costumes on nina balls largely metal set combined with the anachronistic female thanes equally suggested a post apocalyptic future. lady  wears a pre raphealite gown that would have made ellen terry proud a century ago but most of the company women and men seems perpetually dressed for battle. i saw an afternoon matinee in the outdoor theatre kurt landismans atmospheric lights were effective even though muted. the extensive re gendering of characters aided by extensive pronoun changes and other textual adjustments may be more a product of the companys gender parity policy than the directors vision but the immediate effect is a fresh look at the play. lady  is tough but given the world of this production she does not seem particularly villainous as an unending stream of misogynistic versions would have her as much as a product of her times. her statement that she would kill her own child before backing down on her word as she accuses  of considering seems not monstrous but simply a matter of fact. in director brandts hands she is also not easily erased. when her death is announced it is by a character carrying her corpse in a spectacular coup de théâtre. the body is immediately handed to  and he holds it painfully and awkwardly until he goes forth to fight his final battle. oddly in this world it is lady  who seems out of place when she is unwilling or unable to defend herself. her helplessness does not diminish the tragedy of her murder but it does seem surprising given the number of expert swordswomen we have seen and have come to accept as unreable throughout the evening. in this particular environment gender roles are not associated with extremes of masculinity and femininity. both steve pickering as  and  onwumere as  take advantage of this to play more wildly emotional characters than we are used to seeing in these parts. it is a fearless cast but i would not have predicted that this would manifest in leading men as the ability to play their fears and pain so openly. this was the great revelation of the evening. i did not realize how much in most s the thanes masculinity is expressed by emotional detachment and dehumanization until i saw this portrayal which was so vitally alive. pickering was deeply emotional throughout especially in soliloquy and if anything led to his defeat it was that onwumere as  was even more so. not everything about the reworking was successful s equivocating test of  was as interminable as ever for example but seeing so much in an altered context kept the production intriguing even when the pace slowed in the second half. brandts interest was largely in the psychology of character with the supernatural element substantially less prominent than the rupert goold film starring patrick stewart or other recent versions. when it came time to kill  she did select  darek riley to play the mysterious third murderer but the insistent pronunciation see ton rather than the punning say tan told us that in her vision characters control their own fates rather than being manipulated by evil. in this production  escaped his assassination because the murderers were inept not because he was protected. brandt is an exciting director. her production of merry wives of windsor in the same venue a year ago was a revelation because surprise it focused on the wives and not falstaff. it is not fair to suggest that her production of  likewise shifts focus to the women. what it does do is re contextualize both the women and the men so that we can see the story without quite so much sexist baggage. that is a great gift.,5,Tragedy,Positive
Macbeth,The Arden's Flashy Scottish Play,Jennifer Kramer,to enter the e. otto haas auditorium of the arden theatre one must first wind ones way through the dim maze of dark metal scaffolding supporting the seating area before emerging in front of a massive black stone platform surrounded by looming walls their set for . its an appropriate first look at a production that focuses heavily on atmosphere impressing the audience with a visceral sense of doom to foreshadow the characters fates even as they choose their paths themselves. director alexander burns refers to the play as frighteningly modern a concept that pervades the productions aesthetic. brian sidney bembridges scenic design offers an intriguing mix between the an thrust stage and the currently conventional proscenium arch the raised stone circle with irregular wall panels leaning over it like standing stones does not protrude dramatically into the house but their sheer size makes their presence undeniable. the updated an aesthetic of costume designer rosemarie e. mckelvey meanwhile puts the fictionalized 17th century versions of medieval historical figures in modern combat fatigues   then accessorizes with broadswords and plate armor. she is also quite adept at picking up on the clothing imagery in the text itself.  starts the play in plain black fatigues but as he adjusts to the strange garments of his new titles his clothing becomes increasingly ornate culminating in his extravagant coronation outfit an embroidered red and gold waistcoat topped off with a luxurious gold lined crimson velvet cloak and of course his crown. but from there he sheds his layers as he becomes more and more uneasy in his power   first losing the cloak then trading his suit for an elaborate but slightly too large golden robe that does indeed hang loose about him like a giants robe upon a dwarvish thief and finally removing that to reveal once again his black fatigues stripped back to the core of his character. given the attention paid to s outfits and the perfectly serviceable costuming for the rest of the cast one can only wish that lady s dress had received similar care her slinky but ill fitting red gowns and worn boots seem grievously at odds with the characters self presentation. burns clearly has a firm grasp of s text his emendations streamline the action without losing anything vital and he uses the play to establish an intriguing parallel between  ian merrill peakes and  ben dibble. the two start the play in joint battle and at first seem to have similar warmth and affability. though they react very differently to the witches predictions both begin to exhibit paranoia and s fully justified suspicions are given a greater weight when he literally steals the spotlight during s coronation to give them voice   in a robe very similar to the one  dons shortly after no less. the visual motif of his son  holding his sword recurs several times contrasting the predicted future and actual history with s current rise to power until it closes out the play. however one of burns more apparent strengths is using the special effects of the modern theater to augment s text aided by the fantastic work of lighting designer solomon weisbard and sound designer james sugg. lightning flashes thunder rolls and unearthly sound effects peal with pleasing exactness. the fight scenes are a mix of intense stage fighting and stylized slow motion and freeze frames aided by sudden bursts complete darkness the weird sisters meetings take place with strategically deployed fog eerie green filters and disconcerting strobe lighting. but burns also knows when less is more after  has murdered  the stage is lit by a single bright beam from between two of the lurking wall panels like the early morning sun through a window. the effect is both visually unsettling and thematically appropriate as it suggests that s crimes have been exposed to the harsh light of day. despite the epic nature of the production the cast does an excellent job in refusing to let it overwhelm their performances though this does lead to an unfortunate tendency to begin declaiming the dialogue with a side of sweeping hand gestures. the most powerful moments occur when the cast un self consciously portrays these outsized personalities. the sleepwalking breakdown of lady  judith lightfoot clarke is a fascinating and compelling contrast to her previous façade of indomitability. the contortions and shuffling dances of the weird sisters e. ashley izard aimé donna kelly and mary tuomanen are indeed pretty weird but they are at their most supernaturally inhuman when they treat themselves like interchangeable parts intertwining so that each chappy finger lays upon the skinny lips of a sister and neither of the pricking thumbs belongs to the speaker. christopher patrick mullen as the extremely drunk porter provides some contrasting levity when he improvises his knock knock jokes for the modern audience. however this dynamic is best exemplified by ian merrill peakes performance as . his first appearance is during a fight scene intercut with the witches opening speech but peakes almost immediately tempers this bloodthirstiness with genuine friendliness towards  when  and ross show up to praise his exploits hes almost bashful. as the play progresses peakes shows  trying to maintain his social connectivity. after s murder he retains enough self awareness that his answer to s reports of the amazing tumult of the previous evening is an amusingly dry  twas a rough night however he increasingly loses the ability to read his audience and react appropriately. peakes gives an excellent performance of a man spiralling inward as his ambitions trap him in a cycle of paranoia and violence his temper and nervous habit of wiping his hand on his shirt are never extreme but his reactions are consistently off unsettling his subjects and even his wife even as he strives to retain his former temperament. by the time  reveals he was from his mothers womb untimely rippd peakess  simply abandons any pretense of regular human interaction and collapses to the ground before eventually mustering the willpower for a response to this final blow to his ambitions. in his summation of the play burns states that in  we see the will of a man being influenced manipulated and ultimately destroyed by forces outside himself. by giving emphasis to those outside forces the arden theatres production of  offers a compelling and innovative way to illuminate the man destroyed by them   with the finest imitation of lightning the theatre can provide perfectly on cue.,4,Tragedy,Positive
Macbeth,Dagger of the Mind,Jennifer Kramer,in  says director patrick mulcahy the real battlefield lies within the individual psyche and the fog of war therein is thick and treacherous. if hes just a bad guy there is no battle. mulcahys production of the scottish play for the pennsylvania  festival picks up on this theme of psychomachia revealing an interpretation as dark and creative as s own mental state. the theme of conflict   internal and external   is introduced almost immediately with scenic designer bob phillips minimalist set alternating narrow sections of chain link fence stretching from floor to ceiling. its a permeable cage with more than enough room for characters to weave between the barriers but it nevertheless suggests a permanent mental division. the main action always takes place well in front of the fences the liminal area behind them is used for supernatural action or staging representations of normally off stage moments. lisa zinnis costumes further illustrate scotlands unrest as well as her triumph over a unique challenge designing individualized outfits for 20  characters with a color scheme limited to black more black and the occasional shade of grey. instead of descending into an undifferentiable sea of black leather the restricted palette has the opposite effect actively highlighting the differences.  and s sleeveless leather coats suggest their grittier approach to battle lady s gilded bodice and glittery drape of skirt and veil recall a classical statue of some goddess of war s grey dress uniform and fussy cape further the impression that he would rather be anywhere else than the chaos in which he finds himself embroiled s hipster beanie ragged sweater and hoodie fit in with his portrayal as a stargazing dreamer as well as suggesting an underlying familial inclination that explains why  does not also succumb to ambition. costume changes are equally significant. upon ascending the throne  and lady  don complementary black and white outfits at a time when things have never been less black and white lady s particolor dress suggests the warring between her and her husbands better and worse halves while s ombre sleeves recall that his white shirt has been dipped in something considerably worse than black dye. but red the lone available color is used sparingly. it appears only in the bright gradient of the three witches wigs the spots of lady s manicure   and of course the smears of blood. mulcahy is careful to showcase such arresting images and though lighting designer thom weaver works with a similar minimalism   the sets are never fully lit and likewise use a limited color palette   the results are eminently appropriate for the tone and atmosphere of the production. the production opens with the combatants in the cast behind each chain link screen isolated in their own pools of harsh light even as they stand in close ranks the image is reprised while s army marches towards dunsinane as s internal conflict intensifies in act 5. throughout the play glimpses of the fence illuminated in scatters of light add an ominous subtext of confinement and hostility. though many scenes are appropriately lit to resemble some ghoulish nightmare others eschew the obviously sinister for something more subtle before it gains a tinge of red after s murder s castle is lit with a warm golden light deepening the contrast with the shadows clustering on the stage. the detailed work of matthew givens sound design also contributes to the aesthetic. besides the uncanny new age soundtrack an echoing distorted reverb haunts the voices of the three witches and renders even ordinary sounds like a knocking at the castle door or the shriek of some night bird truly alarming. if one reads the production as a reflection of s psyche ian bedfords performance as the title character certainly conveys a grimly ordered mind nevertheless prone to emotional   or supernatural   disruption. bedfords  begins the play as the perfect soldier physically imposing and with a certain bluff honesty and he manages to maintain this façade even after his better qualities have been twisted to dark purposes. he is all reason and affability during his meeting with s murderers held during a wine tasting that becomes almost a ghoulish parody with the conflict between its appearance and purpose. but during s private moments and later his all too public breaks with reality his guilt reduces him to tears and terror. like  the witches first appear as honest citizens the play begins with the bloody captain deanna gibson staggering across the stage to to report on the state of the battle before succumbing to her injuries  only to rise from the dead and with the two field medics suzanne odonnell and valerie berger attending her don darkened glasses and chant the plays opening lines. this cycle repeats throughout the play and gibson odonnell and berger smoothly transition from the earnest side characters they appear to be   like the porter or lady s attendant   to the unearthly weird sisters in the closing moments of their scenes. susan riley stevens lady  meanwhile is sharp and fierce from the beginning   but also possesses a certain brittleness even from her first appearance. her unsex me here soliloquy seems as much a plea to herself as to the spirits to overcome the considerable physical anxiety from the course she has already planned out for her husband and herself. the rest of the cast likewise turn in uniformly strong performances   which in a way is part of the productions one flaw. each character seems fully cognizant of some aspect of scotlands doom and expresses this with an emphatic gravity. but between this and mulcahys languid pacing any contrasts within the productions nightmarish reality are few and far between. in this case there is no light to sharpen the shadows. however no matter how sedate the ride one cannot deny that it is exquisitely planned and executed. the darkness and confusion within s own mind plays out in gorgeous imagery as the treacherous fog of war rolls across the stage. though  loses the battle with himself the psfs atmospheric and visually striking production ensures that every step of his mental break is incredibly memorable.,4,Tragedy,Positive
Macbeth,The Scottish Fall Thriller,Jennifer Kramer,for the hedgerow theatres ninetieth anniversary it was decided that their fall thriller slot would be filled by . director don hodge delivers with a quickly paced and supernatural production   one that relies on the play itself to elicit some seasonal creepiness. the setting is moved to the great war at least nominally. while cathie miglionicos costume design makes some nods to that era the result is more impressionistic than period. she does have a few nice touches tartans are used sparingly but effectively for royalty while the trailing cloaks and gas masks that completely obscure the weird sisters are genuinely creepy. lady s black mourning gown introduces some hints to her troubled state of mind and the matching red dressing gowns donned by the leading couple after their first murder are a nice moment of almost black comedy. however overall the costumes come off as general approximations of the times uniforms suits and gowns rather than an attempt to exploit the attributes of more specifically edwardian dress. meanwhile zoran kovcics scenic design is not so much in tune with the productions setting as it is with its atmosphere. the gloomy wooden staircases that mainly stand in for s castle could come from any era though in combination with the theaters rough stone walls they evoke a distinct haunted abandoned cabin in the woods aesthetic which enhances the mood of the production. hodges failure to fully explore his chosen setting is frustrating especially when the few aspects he does choose to highlight are so effective. the witches gas masks render them inhumanly uncanny and replacing more typical thunder and night bird sound effects with the roar of planes and scream of missiles grounds the horror in real world concerns in addition to more mystical ones. this failure could almost be ignored in favor of the more prominent role of the supernatural in the story but for the plays slightly disappointing conclusion after  promises to restore order to scotland the witches pop up from their hiding places as red lights flood the stage. its the dramatic equivalent of a pounding scare chord something of a letdown from the productions previous reliance on strong performances and nicely subtle lighting and sound effects to create its horror. furthermore given that  parcells  thus far has been guilty of nothing more than having an ill timed sense of humor its difficult to anchor a believable sense of foreboding on such an affable character especially when the obvious parallels to the failure in leadership that led to world war is bloody sequel are not exploited. the actors too only pay a passing nod to the setting making use of the early twentieth centurys fascination with spiritualism while ignoring the heady combination of jingoism and shellshock that powered the war to end all wars. however their performances do connect on a more personal level that brings some intriguing nuances to the production. jared reed though unconvincing as a general who meant to bathe in reeking wounds or memorise another golgotha is excellent as a man who allows his ambition rein as a way to comfort his beloved wife and seek earthly power in recompense for their personal tragedies. these are illuminated by jennifer summerfield whose almost fragile but still compelling lady  has very clearly suffered the death of a child and both she and reed show the couples heartbreaking love as they try to recover from the loss. the two also excel at showing the s sense of entitlement to the position promised them and how their relationship gives them the strength for the necessary ruthlessness to attain it. however their love is ultimately no match for the guilt their actions provoke and reed and summerfield highlight the tragic romance that accompanies their tragic ambition after lady  is driven to suicide  offers  no resistance in their final confrontation refusing to yield but also refusing to go on without his wife. the paranormal aspects of the production are some of its strongest elements with a firm basis in several of the casts performances. david blatt plays  now a composite of the sergeant the porter the third murderer and various servants and who has never been more appropriately named. resurrected by the witches at the beginning of the play  appears as an agent of chaos alternating between helpfully murdering  and lady  not murdering  and s infant child telling evil knock knock jokes and giving  sardonically judging looks. the role appears to be a combination of both jeeves and the butler who committed the crime in the stereotypical whoddunnit and blatt strikes an excellent balance between extremely dry humor and chilling blandness keeping the characters motives obscure but ominous throughout the production. however the plays iconic three witches   portrayed by susan wefel rebecca jane cureton and lily dwoskin   are unambiguously sinister. eschewing a more typical cackling for unearthly shrieks the three actresses imbue the famous lines of their spells with an unnervingly satanic bent and perfectly mirror each other in keening contorted performances that are genuinely frightening. hodges adaptation of the text smoothly combines characters and scenes for an original spin that is nevertheless firmly based on s own intentions. with the efforts of a talented cast and crew the result is a tight paranormal thriller both highly appropriate for the season and an exciting perspective on a classic play.,4,Tragedy,Positive
Macbeth,There Will Be Blood,Melissa Crismon,will there be blood? that was the question at  orange county. the company held a fundraiser in hopes to buy the blood for the  production. they achieved their goal. then the question became   for the audience   how much blood? it was a night of anticipation wondering how far the director would push interpretation. director thomas f. bradac begins with a strong cast of actors.  walcutts  and evelyn carol cases lady  are emotionally and physically committed. all those famous lines stand out such as out damn spot and something wicked this way comes   a quotation used for a title of ray bradburys 1962 book. the stage is bloody and torn telling whats to come. its not too bloody and not gory at all. though director bradac does expect to add more blood to  since he comes back from the grave. the tone is macabre but the emphasis is exploring the human condition.  walcutts  shows how there is good and evil in all of us. his character is initially likeable but then he is misguided by his wife lady . through walcutts soliloquies the audience is captivated by his rationale of wanting to do the right thing to being manipulated and eventually succumbing to evil and sex. after  is killed the porter craig brown walks in drunk a reprieve as he jests how man can be easily manipulated through sex and alcohol. brown asks for money  from those who walk in getting a laugh from the audience. evelyn carol cases lady  is manipulative through sex as she takes hold of walcutts manhood to nag him into her evil doing. she too has many spotlighted moments as she goes crazy talking while sleep walking saying to bed to bed to bed. when she completely loses her mind case gives out an unnerving shrieking scream. when she dies walcutt does not go to her side gone are the passionate kisses. carl reggiardo as  is supporting in his role to  as comrade in war. reggiardo becomes jumpy fearing for his life. once dead he quietly walks on stage and sits at the table with  lady  and the lords. walcutt asks if anyone else sees what he is seeing. he walks away from the table as reggiardo points at him. cases lady  tries to calm her husband to the point of frustration. she plays the nagging wife perfectly. the three sisters played by alyssa bradac harrison givens and cindy nguyen add an evil element as they speak their spells in a monochromatic possessed voice swaying in place to the thunder and drumming. torn and holey white fabric hangs from the rafters and a wood bridge rises and falls for the cast of characters. red paint for blood drips from the stage. lights shine through the slightly transparent fabric casting an eerie tone set by mfa scenic design candidate at uc irvine eric barker. through the medici scholar award he was able to spend the summer of 2012 interning with international and broadway scenic designer allen moyer. some of the props by david l. phillips are detailed shriveled heads on poles carried out by various cast members parading in front of . the helmet held by  is metal with cut out rows. costume designer katie wilson uses a trinity of colors black grey and red. one of lady s flattering dresses has a black bodice with mesh arms and a shimmery skirt that has a top draping layer.  wears a white shirt with black vest with metal tracery a thick black jacket dark plaid pants and boots. some of the costuming pieces look like the actors brought their own boots and clothing to keep in budget but stays within the motif. the weird sisters arent the typical dressed in black witches. their faces are painted white to look like zombies. alyssa bradac is the living dead shrouded in greyish torn cotton. cindy nguyen has a little bit of everything with a tight taffeta blue dress cut high with black spandex shorts attached to garters hinting of a hooker. harrison givenss eclectic look of dreadlocks with swimming goggles and black clothes and boots is a little bit punk rocker reggae.  and jennifer georges original music utilizes haunting drumming to announce the entrance of the scottish lords. thunder and stormy sounds encourage the weird sisters in their incantations. with commitment to the text the production is engaging and plays at an even pace. socs  is immensely entertaining with its just right mixture of drama comic relief visual splendor and sound effects.,5,Tragedy,Positive
Macbeth,Macbeth Express,Craig Melson,a play like  is notoriously hard to do in an original way but titian theatre makes their attempt stand out with a lightning fast production. its a tall order to compress such a convoluted play into just over an hour and a half and an even taller order for the audience but director amber elliott manages the task superbly. tom blyths  isnt brooding consumed and controlling as one would expect but nervous overly paranoid and frightened. he jumps when people come to see him. he gives off little authority and this new take is refreshing. out with the determination to beat his fate and assert his will in with just trying to survive for as long as he can like a high school cheerleader in a low budget slasher film. blyths performance is detailed and he has taken on this interpretation with relish. completely in awe and dominated by louise ryans lady  blyth is constantly on his knees crawling around and snuggling in to her. its a physically demanding role and the pace is frantic as  tries to murder his way out of his problems. the relationship between  and his lady seems designed to highlight his gradual loosening grip on reality. they are passionate and all over each other at the start but they become increasingly disinterested with each other and cold  exemplified by the ease with which  accepts the death of his wife. the rest of the exceptionally small cast work through the play quickly at times downed out by s energy and bounding across the stage. the witches entrance lying in pitch black on the floor is striking. on the production element the visuals and sounds are terrific. the costuming too adds to the atmosphere and what is missing in props and scenery is made up for here. the decision to go down the traditional medieval route is a good one with authentic robes armour and dresses throughout.particular attention is paid to the brutal fights with fight choreographer lyndell grant introducing variety and suspense. despite knowing the story and ultimately who wins each fight it is still genuinely exciting to watch. the music accompanying each blow sets the scene fantastically acting as a second stage manager for the actors. ultimately this is an engaging and frantic production. much has been cut and it becomes more about  and his descent into tyranny and less about the struggle for a kingdom. blyth is a force to behold and the production which is bare is excellent engaging and a genuinely original adaptation of a timeless and well worn tale.,4,Tragedy,Positive
Macbeth,Cauldrons Bubble...In A Guildford Church,Christopher Adams,guildford  companys  tells a story and it tells that story very well. there is no concept foisted on the production but neither is the text the only thing on offer. this  is theatrical unashamedly so. under caroline devlins direction a strong cast and an equally strong production team create a fast paced engaging show. holy trinity church yes a church   more on that later home to previous successful productions such as  and richard iii both also directed by devlin finds itself yet again creatively transformed. designed by sarah bacon a raised diamond stage rests in the centre of the sanctuary audience seated on all four sides. toward the altar stands another rectangular stage useful for entrances and tableaux  on the throne the dinner banquet. the decision to play  almost but not quite in the round leads to some stunning moments. as tom mcgoverns  frets on the central stage having just committed murder johanne murdocks lady  suddenly appears near the altar framed by the rood screen her hands pointed outward palms covered in blood. large wooden hatched freestanding structures tower over the audience providing a place for two of the three weird sisters ben ashton matt pinches to hover while the third hayley doherty conjures on the centre stage. the sisters are well conceived agile and surprisingly vulnerable. the spell to call up the birnam wood prophecy leaves the sisters huddled together their energy sapped. the trio is especially effective in its movement aided by excellent work from movement director vanessa cook. the costumes also by bacon are medieval ish with dark modern twists chain mail tops with black army boots for instance. as with the rest of the production values the costumes are well executed and serve the story without encumbering it. and what a story. the play runs at a crisp two hours not including interval with the action never abating. the eight member cast plus an ensemble of five are kept on their toes with a flurry of costume and character changes. mcgovern as  moves constantly about the stage. he and murdock achieve a gripping tension in the post murder scene treating the dialogue as something out of a modern play with rapid fire delivery. murdocks lady  has a strong clear arc and a fully believable descent into madness. ben aston as  and morgan philpott as  bring a dark stillness to their duologue. devlin never pulls her punches the fights by fight director philip dorleans are grim and bloody.  the very good noel white meets a particularly stomach churning end. an eerie soundscape of bagpipes and unnerving hollow music underprops the production compliments of sound designer matt eaton. lights by declan randall are equally atmospheric and creative  when birnam wood comes to dunsinane its a sight to behold. recent productions of  have included  in a prison  in a riot  in underground tunnels  with a giant cloth over the audience. but theres something disturbing twisted and powerful about  in a church. after s murder randall lights the cross above the rood screen in a lurid provocative red. the juxtaposition of the religious surroundings and the often jarring stage action witches murder highlights the extent to which otherworldly forces are mentioned and at work in the play. at the same time the explicitly religious setting provides a framework for understanding s rise and fall evil is evil and it is allowed to be so but it is overcome in the end. guildford  company has an established history of very solid productions and this  is no exception. with keen attention to production values strong acting and the theatrical experience the company gets to the heart of good storytelling.,4,Tragedy,Positive
Macbeth,How to Ruin Macbeth (Intentionally),J. A. Macfarlane,the very name  comes haloed with a certain gravitas even when considering his comedies the great playwright the wise man according to harold bloom the very inventor of humanity. it is wonderful therefore to see this balloon punctured on occasion and it is rarely done as well as in david mcgillivray and walter zerlins madcap the farndale avenue housing estate townswomens guild dramatic societys production of  occasionally also known by the superstitious as the farndale avenue housing estate townswomens guild dramatic societys production of the scottish play an evening out that quite redefines the concept of breaking the fourth wall   or rather does away with the concept of the fourth wall altogether. the play is only partly by mcgillivray and zerlin as a certain amount of it is by one  .you see we the audience are not actually attending theatre erindales production of the farndale avenue   look you dont mind if i just call it farndales  do you?it saves a certain amount of virtual ink. rather we are in southern england attending a performance of s  by a townswomens guild in 1982.unfortunately for the good ladies of the guild mr. murphy is out in full force at their performance everything that could possibly go wrong does beginning with the fact that lady  is stuck in traffic and must be replaced by the very male stage manager.beyond that and to the misfortune of the 1982 audience even if all were to go right this performance of  would be pretty dreadful.luckily however for us as audience in 2013 the terrible performance is in fact a good performance so that everything that goes wrong is actually going right for us.which is in practice a great deal less convoluted than it sounds. all we need to do is sit back and enjoy   and restrain ourselves from falling off our chairs while laughing.there were reports of audience members having difficulty breathing from laughter the night i saw the show. let it not be said that i provide no health warnings. the guilds performance is particularly important to them as they are competing in an amateur dramatic competition bringing about the presence of an observing adjudicator mr. george peach just in case there werent enough layers to the evening already. so it is very important for their cast of six to do their very best.it is also very important for the theatre erindale cast to get their performances right   or wrong as the case may be. farndales  gives them a perfect opportunity to massacre  but brings with it the challenge of massacring him in a particular way. all in all they pull it off with delightfully atrocious overacting cues properly missed and the occasional explosion in a zany evening fully in tune with the companys season theme of mayhem. full disclosure farndales  was the very first play i ever worked on as a stagehand and this doubtless colours my reactions and expectations as well as my conviction that that the explosion that ends act one is not apocalyptic enough for its purpose. but though the play is tightly scripted and can appear not to offer much variety in terms of staging potential patrick youngs direction reminded me that there are always alternative possibilities in a play script. he marshalls his forces well and keeps up the necessary pace for a farce sometimes even a bit too much. young deserves full credit for putting on this play and for succeeding in its having no disasters other than the intentional ones. at least if there were any unplanned disasters they were indistinguishable from the required ones. the erindale casts quality is uniform particularly their various british accents for which speech  dialect coach meredith scott deserves due praise.as the wittering and very proper mrs. reece president of the guild lady  doctor megan janssen is a wonderfully bustling presence handbag permanently attached glasses precarious at the tip of her nose and raffle tickets always ready for sale. carolyn nettletons minnie  s son displays great virtuosity in her pseudo scottish accent occasional time filling sword dancing and especially the difficult art of duelling against oneself to the death. karyn mcgibbon dawn     porter 2nd murderer 1st witch is very good at losing her glasses and stumbling into the set with all attendant disasters. managing to duel as if blind without actually hitting anyone is no mean accomplishment. tavia pereiras felicity is profoundly hilarious in her deep dyed villainy as  and the 1st murderer   she would be well suited to the role of luciano in s the mousetrap   as well as seemingly one of the more competent members of the guild also taking on the 2nd witch  and gentlewoman.unfortunately she is forever upstaged for the real 2013 audience if not necessarily the pretend 1982 audience by kate 3rd witch messenger  played by alyssandria messina who has broken her ankle and therefore hobbles throughout the performance on crutches until after one missed cue too many she is chivvied off the stage to rather disturbing background noises and returns in a wheelchair with an arm in a sling being pushed around by the director. she valiantly continues managing a memorable final virtually immobile duel with . and then theres thelma the companys diva who of course plays  as well as ross.thelma is a juicy role and cassondra padfield bites into it with gusto.inordinately certain of her own brilliance determined that this is her show losing her temper walking out swearing at the other cast members she is every theatre persons worst nightmare played to the hilt. padfield is particularly skilled at the art of taking centre stage   not merely aiming poor kates wheelchair towards the back of the set and locking its wheels but notably adept at using her sleeves to mask the other actors faces. her overacting as ross and her extended death are note perfect in their awfulness. the only issue with padfields performance though is that she sometimes comes perilously close to doing a good    though the script usually saves her from actually doing so. it seems rather a shame that in this play about a townswomens guild aside from thelma it is the men who get the plummiest roles.but so it is. shanghaied into playing lady  stage manager henry who has already ruined the opening of the play by putting the set up back to front provides what must be one of the most memorable performances of the role the world has seen. michael esposito ii does not attempt to play lady  instead retaining his unplaceable lower class accent and blithely going through the gestures in a low cut gown displaying a great deal of chest hair along with the occasional nipple and work boots all accentuated by his slim moustache and unshaven chin. esposito is especially good at conveying henrys profound discomfort at playing a woman as well as creating a quite credible portrait of a young down to earth man who happens to like the theatre and is not in any way an actor. his burst from richard iii when his memory fails is suitably well received. meanwhile ben hayward is excellent as mr. plummer the director who is having the worst night of his life. though it seems a bit unlikely that it took him nine months of rehearsals to realise that his cast cant act the sheer tizzy into which he is thrown as the disaster unfolds is quite enjoyable. the role can seem unrewarding mostly confined to existential despair and hopes that his mother wont learn of this but hayward gets his moment of glory when the cast is informed that they have to finish within minutes and thelma walks out.taking over the lead role plummer no not that plummer does the fastest act 5 scene 4 in recorded history. hayward rips through the flight of the thanes lady s death tomorrow and tomorrow and the discovery that birnam wood is on the move at blistering speed a tongue twisting and memory defying act that had me wishing for a stopwatch   a performance that deserves an ovation of its own particularly since im reasonably certain not a word of the original was left out. kudos also to tavia pereira who as the messenger had to match the speed. stealing every moment he is given is  di rosa and his glittering jacket as the fatuous adjudicator george peach. whether performing magic tricks suffering through mrs. reeces inability to get his name right falling asleep throughout the performance or subjecting us to a rip roaring rendition of vesti la giubba di rosa milks his role for all its worth. he is also quite ravishing in his lilac sequined dress at the end. dont ask. lastly one must recognise the contribution of one actor unaccountably left out of the programme namely the inflatable palm tree that is the centrepiece of the forest of birnam   a scene stealer of no mean ability whose future seems assured. one can only trust that  would have appreciated being skewered in this manner as farndales  is a worthy successor to his own swipes at amateur dramatics in a midsummer nights dream and loves labours lost. anyone who has ever participated in amateur theatre will be in stitches as the all too recognisable characters ruin one of s great plays. as daggers on strings threaten the stars eyesight and the witches perform a show stopping turn of that old black magic round their cauldron no really one can only be reassured that at least nothing ever goes quite so wrong in real life. does it?,5,Tragedy,Positive
All's Well That Ends Well,"Macbeth Down Under, Now With 100% More Drugs",J. A. Macfarlane,geoffrey wrights  is likely the single most unpretentious  film you will ever see. at no point does it ever pretend to be anything other than what it is a low budget australian gangster film that just happens to use the plot and some of the dialogue of s play. whether or not this is a good thing depends on your viewpoint. on the one hand it does in many ways massacre . on the other it is a huge amount of fun and improves after a glass or two of wine. it is not a film for a serious discussion of the play but it is great entertainment. placing  in the context of gang wars is a divergence from the more common updating in which it is played in one of the great wars of the 20th century but in many ways this choice makes greater sense. one of the best ways to explain the feudal system to someone is to have them watch the godfather likewise those unfamiliar with  but aware of the conventions of gangster movies will instantly grasp the political intricacies of the relationship among the characters in . the domains of the thanes in the play become the nightclubs for which they are responsible the rebellion is a drug deal gone wrong masterminded by the owner of the cawdor who is apparently hoping to eliminate if not  at least all of his high command. s instincts and fighting ability save the day and uncover the plot in a vicious shootout and pursuit. yet  who was in charge of the deal and is clearly incompetent is still named as successor by  who is deeply relieved that his son survived. from there the plot takes its familiar route. but this is not the beginning of the film and what comes before is perhaps the most interesting of the choices made by the adapters. the witches are a trio of schoolgirls desecrating a graveyard who pass by  and his wife as the latter mourn at the grave of their son. the relationship between the married pair is rooted in this sorrow which has clearly overtaken lady s mind. while waiting for  to arrive at the cawdor  and  get stoned and    meets? hallucinates?   the witches in the shape of the schoolgirls he saw earlier that day. returning home he finds lady  half drowned in the bathtub the same bath in which she will much later be found with her wrists cut. it is to distract her that he tells her of the prophecies. when he comes back to announce s visit it is while high on cocaine that lady  seduces him to the murder. later it is the sight of a family photo of the s with their young son in the centre that truly pushes her into her suicidal spiral. hill is superb as lady  stealing every scene she is in whether as grief stricken mother stoned seductress gracious and charming hostess or in the horror of the realisation of what she and her husband have done. in fact she is the only one of the cast one can readily envision in a more conventional production of the play. she is hardly the only drug addled character in the film. s insane root that takes the reason prisoner is omnipresent and s increasing dementia as the plot progresses is certainly attributable to their use. certainly the other characters response to his visions suggests that they simply think him stoned and his disintegration prompts his abandonment by his followers. the cauldron scene becomes a pornographic fantasy with the naked and nubile witches mounting and subjugating him. the question of the witches present in every production   whether they are real or not or whether they are simply emanations of s psyche the actualisation of his desires and in this case his giving in to his fantasies about the three schoolgirls he passed at the graveyard   is particularly brought to the fore in this telling. that they are merely drugged fuelled dreams would seem clear were it not for the opening scene where the witches prepare to meet . this is not to imply that everything hangs together. even with a text sliced to ribbons occasionally stitched back together with a few lines of pastiche and often awkward alterations to make the words better match the 21st century setting it is impossible to make the original story and the story being told in this film completely match up. for instance the gangsters in this film are under observation by the police and it soon becomes obvious that they take the place of the english to whom  flies. but while it is not impossible to imagine the police quietly letting one group of gangsters take out another when  and  take their revenge on  it is less easy to understand why they would arm the former let alone allow a teenaged boy to go along on the raid and apparently not arrest anyone at the end. likewise it is somewhat difficult to accept  as the good guy when he is as much a mobster as anyone else. this would not necessarily be a problem   it is a common side effect of mob movies   except that it sits uneasily with the original text. likewise one can question why  has to come along on the final raid sneak in follow the wounded  as he climbs the stairs to die next to his wifes body and then instinctively shoot lady s maid who has not left the house   a moment that im afraid makes me laugh every time i see it. still that laughter may be intentional as the saving grace of the film is its refusal to take itself too seriously. it is common in modernised versions of s plays to find an excuse for the constant use of certain words the best example being how the guns in baz luhrmans     were seen to be made by the sword company but i have never seen so witty a use of the convention as when  and  use a lumber truck to burst through the gates of dunsinane. the truck of course is from the birnam timber company. likewise there is the wink at s status as the scottish play when in preparation for what will clearly be his last fight  dons a leather kilt and performs the most jaw dropping highland fling since simon callow in four weddings and a funeral. for that matter speaking of s vestimentary eccentricities it should be noted that though the film is a fairly superficial take on the play it has its moments of matching the original imagery. famously  is often referred to in the play   only once in the film as being someone wearing clothes too big for him. while this metaphor would be ridiculous if actualised this  manages to achieve something of the same effect through s absolutely appalling taste in clothes. particularly noticeable is the suit he wears at the party celebrating his nomination as gang leader. in contrast to the beautifully dressed  or the dapper  or even the jacket and tie wearing   decks himself in a ghastly gaudy velvet suit that looks as though it were made from leftover carpeting if not wallpaper so cringe inducing one is left amazed that anyone would think him an appropriate replacement for . considering lady s elegance it is clear that she lets  choose his own clothes. slickly filmed  often has a music video feel to it particularly in s encounters with the witches. as the first takes place in a nightclub where the stoned  puts on the fake mist and the lightshow this is hardly surprising.  this alternates with the cold and grey scenes of reality as s enemies gather against him. the final battle with its hints of the finale of scarface is a slow motion ballet with the guns laser guides piercing through the mist of smoke grenades inescapably heralding s doom. though there is nothing eye dropping or noticeably inventive in the cinematography it never clashes with the tone of the adaptation and the transitions between the various styles do not clash. to say that this is not a purists version is a gross understatement in fact it is barely even a coles notes version. but as an adaptation of the story one has to admit that all the elements are there including the s status as the happiest married couple in . it is not impossible to wish that the makers had gone all the way and changed the dialogue as well in which case one would have an australian gangster movie roughly equivalent to kurosawas an transformations in terms of adaptation not in terms of quality but within the limitations they set themselves it must be acknowledged that they succeed.,4,Comedy,Positive
Macbeth,Is This a Tracksuit I See Before Me?,Craig Melson, is a seasoned veteran of being set in different scenarios asylums communist era bunkers even outer space. so when a company describes their production as updated for the 21st century you have to take it with a pinch of salt. in breakfast cat theatres production directed by paul grace the company transposes the scottish play onto the riots that shook london in summer 2011. the conceit has promise as the backstabbing and plotting fit in as well to modern street gangs as it does to medieval scottish nobility but overall the production fails to move the text into new directions. the play begins up tempo with the entire tracksuit adorned cast aimlessly running amok amongst the audience with bags of clothes trainers and boxes of electronic gear. grace opts for an earthly  with much of the supernatural removed. the witches are reduced to three alco pop swigging trouble makers and the banquet scene does away with the ghost leaving the audience to think  is paranoid and imagining the whole thing. this point is emphasised when  is seen shooting up with the witches who are receiving picture messages and texts from their familiars. roberto prestoni who plays the title character is intense but flat. he is sneering and paranoid in his portrayal a choice to show how drugged up he is but we miss any sense of up and down within the character. his other half  nattress is brilliant as a glamorous and ambitious lady . however nattress does not seem to fit in because of her classy clothes and pronunciation that is out of sync with the chavvy and urban look of the play. she is a great lady  playing the role with subtly and elegance but is too different from everyone else. grace clearly wants to distinguish her as the real power but goes too far. by casting the rest of the characters as gang members their nobility is removed entirely. even though  is the king its very clear hes only king of a small part of the underworld. upon his murder a news announcement plays that a gang members body has been found in a car park which contrasts the overly lofty tones and ambitions of the language with the insignificance of a gang. the supporting cast might as well be all the same person with  and lady  getting much more stage time than in other performances. there is some attempt to play about with the text. monologues are read out as texts and the banquet scene replaces standard banquet fare with pizza boxes cans of lager and vodka bottles. and as mentioned above  goes into a fit of hysteria but there is no ghost who appears. the staging is bare with only some bean bags and stools perhaps more could have been done to make it look more like the crack den they were supposed to be in. music is used sparingly but very plausible news announcements mentioning different plot lines are good plot indicators especially for much of the audience who were from local schools. the breakfast cats production tries putting a new take on the well worn scottish play. it is an interesting update and works as a piece of theatre but lack of variety in the cast and somewhat monotone performances dull its effectiveness making it work better as an anti drug and gang advert than as a piece of high art.,3,Tragedy,Negative
Macbeth,Macbeth in the Slammer,Craig Melson,plays are often sold as interactive or atmospheric but none will be able to compete with this version of  for those two adjectives. belt up theatres version is performed in a preserved victorian prison that has been closed to the public for years. the typical idea of theatre has been re imagined. you never stay in the same part of the pitch black underground complex for more than a few scenes as you follow the candle wielding actors from one part of the prison to another and aside from one scene you are walking the whole time. you genuinely feel in the drama as you solemnly follow the actors and take in the eerie damp stone walls. indeed the prison is unused except for tv productions and should be a future obvious choice for stage productions. the cast is very small with only four actors in the whole production. it manages to succeed despite this with all the actors diverse enough to make it work. only dominic allen has a single role as the murderous and scheming  and he plays his role with authority. his delivery and movement are powerful and he becomes more assured as he murders his way to the top. the remaining cast have a more difficult challenge particularly serena manteghi who is lady  lady  and the lead witch. she is excellent but appears visibly tired at the end from having three major roles. joe hufton who is   and a witch has the versatility required with such a small cast. sam connolly   a witch and other minor roles has few costume changes and his roles are not easily distinguishable but he does a fine job in his intense and angry standoff with . overall though the production could have done with one more actor to take some of the burden off of the three supporting actors. the play is intimate with actors mixing with the audience no more than ten feet away at any given time. this allows them to be more facially expressive and use quieter more natural tones as opposed to the usual bellowing and voice throwing that often removes the natural sounds from shakespearian language. the production is full of shocks. the only part of the prison with seating sees the small audience seated as s dinner guests. other individual moments stack up nicely too such as the grisly and realistic strangling of lady . she writhes and fights before having the breath squashed out of her.  even draggs the corpse along the floor into a nearby cell. the fully naked  ghost shocks everyone as does the candlelit circle which sees the witches played by the remaining cast entrance the title character. the costumes are conservative with director david calvitto leading on these with rosie townsend. they opt for a military feel with officer uniforms and stasi esque behaviour very much like rupert goolds acclaimed production a few years ago. the play is a masterpiece in direction and stage management with so much activity even with actors appearing like ghosts in crevices in the old prison.  each part of the deceptively large complex offers something new and much thought has gone into the setting where acoustics differed to enhance scenes. props are at a bare minimum as are music and sound. this is a must see performance and runs in the house of detention clerkenwell until may 18. bring a thick jumper as a damp victorian prison doesnt exactly sing heat and leave early as the theatre is well hidden amongst the old streets of dickenss london. it is a haunting and brilliantly fresh production of a very well some say over used play.,5,Tragedy,Positive
All's Well That Ends Well,Stewart is Sublime in Goold's Gory Show,Vikki Jane Vile,it is always difficult to return to a play when your last experience of it was truly horrendous such is the case with . so despondent was i by the last local production i viewed i approached this newly modernised version starring patrick stewart and directed by rupert goold with trepidation. however thankfully here is the perfect imagining of s classic tragedy to convert me back to a lover of this gory tale. goolds 2010 film  based on his 2007 stage production  is totally original and unlike any i have seen before it is modern fast and incredibly bloody leaving me surprised that it only warranted a 12 certificate but undoubtedly it is brilliant. set in an undefined and threatening central european world which serves to make the action even more unsettling the viewer is left to wonder about where the action is actually taking place which similarly adds to the sense of claustrophobia as we see endless stretches of corridors filled by the witches industrial grime and sinister darkened rooms. additionally there are also no references to time frame leaving the viewer at even more of a loss. stewart is one of the greatest an actors ever and plays the lead role with great subtlety and vulnerability which in the early stages of the film lead me to believe his  was not capable of the murders that follow. stewart is likeable and seemingly not naturally bloodthirsty in the role his motivation coming from kate fleetwoods fascinating portrayal of lady . she is watchable with her pale skin startling looks and tense limbs if a little guilty of overplaying her descent into madness. however she is highly competent in the role of wife to the protoagonist. in contrast stewart is wonderfully understated his greed and fear tinged with a private desperation while his wife serves to encourage these weaknesses in many ways she provides the backbone stewarts  sometimes appears to lack. the camerawork is also significant. in stewarts integral is this a dagger i see before me? speech we see these lines spoken in one prolonged take demonstrating amply how stewart requires no assisting no distracting special effects or props simply one steady angle and those immortal words. in contrast the portrayal of the witches and other minor characters are where this production thrives in the modernisation category. camerawork is jerky uncomfortable and dramatic the witches guise as nurses offers many excuses for the extensive use of blood and dead bodies aplenty too. from the outset they are disturbing almost otherworldly despite their medical costuming. their chants of all hail  hail to thee   thane of cawdor resemble those of the greek chorus and set the dark tone that pervades the entire production. and it is this darkness that provides my one complaint. the actors are faultless in the roles they portray and i happily accept  is one of the more gory plays i could wish to watch but is there really need for a gun riffle or world of war craft moment in every other scene? perhaps im too delicate for this sinister  business? all in all though this is a stunning production of s classic the technical aspects matching the skills of the well chosen cast. perhaps the most impressive scene is that of the royal banquet not only exquisitely directed in s vision of  martin turner standing bloody faced on the dining table and franticly dancing but enhanced by the engrossing dynamic between  and lady  and topped off by the fittingly grand costuming. the scene is the embodiment of why goolds production is so chillingly brilliant and a must for a lover of the bard although one should perhaps be wary of the severed heads and dead bodies that tend to fly around. watch the performance online here.,4,Comedy,Positive
Macbeth,Macbeth Is Not The Only Tragedy in This Uninspiring Production ,Vikki Jane Vile,as i approach the taachi morris arts centre in taunton somerset i am full of hope for my new role as south west correspondent at play.com. i am eager to show that down here in the west country we are more than just cows and cream teas and that our theatre scene is a respectable one too. sadly the experience i have watching platform 4s production of  is not the performance to demonstrate this. the arts centre is a small but impressive venue located just out of taunton town centre with a theatre that can hold approximately 200 people. on taking my seat i am first surprised by the lack of any set whatsoever as i am met by a completely blank stage and ask myself whether this production has any kind of creative or artistic team at all. directed by simon plumridge the opening witches scene instead of immediately setting the menacing tone prompts titters of amusement from its young audience. the witches emit comical groans and moans their faces covered in black material which also forms the rest of their costuming with what looks like a rope tied around their waists for good measure. the hilarity established only gathers momentum as the lines are delivered to an already tickled audience. more positive contributions include james bellorini who plays a largely convincing  and is undoubtedly one of the stronger elements of this production although his anger and madness does not particularly build up to a great climax. essentially he starts loud and brooding and dies loud and brooding. tamsin fessey as lady  plays the role adequately too creating strong sense of desperation and fear present within the couple once the murders are committed. such performances are not enough however to detract from the extreme lack of any artistic creativity in the costuming staging or lighting. i am aware this is a time where arts funding is at a minimal but the blandness of the costuming cannot be overlooked. occasions that should be portrayed as full of pomp and ceremony such as the banquet in act three are indicated only by a change of jacket and modest table added to the blank stage. with such a young audience 90% of those in attendance were under 18 at my viewing waiting to be captivated and for their english gcse to be brought alive its no wonder  is regarded as inaccessible by many young people these days. bland costuming and basic lighting which is sometimes so faint the audience struggle to see facial expressions soon equals boredom the productions main saving grace being its shortness in length two and a half hours with one interval. i leave the theatre disappointed. at times the cast of actors whose pedigree judging from the programme is highly respectable in most cases began to shine they delivered the content convincingly and professionally but whether it is the small venue or weakness of the artistic team led by catherine church which colludes to this productions downfall i leave believing it was not just  who had been victim to a tragedy but the audience too.,2,Tragedy,Negative
Macbeth,Macbeth Laid Bare,Archie Maddocks,. a play notorious for its darkened dialogue and at times terrifying imagery. one of s most quoted and widely discussed works. with this in mind one would usually encounter the play on a large stage with a large audience. however with the production at barons court theatre this was not the case. below a quaint corner pub lies the theatre itself. in a way this served as both a curse and a blessing. unfortunately the pub seemed to be quite popular the night that i watched the play which led to numerous disruptions from lost patrons seeking bathroom facilities or generally having a us wander. occasionally you would hear the rolling of a beer filled barrel rattle across the ceiling briefly bringing you out of the tense atmosphere established by the actors. once or twice the crowd above would erupt into raucous cheering while watching some sport in the bar. despite these numerous distractions however i could not help but be captured by brave production of  put on by hiraeth artistic productions. the intimacy of the venue adds to s eerie and darkened atmosphere. the audience are plunged into a battle ridden murderous space in time and are dragged through the psychological turmoil experienced by the protagonist with admiral poise. there are only fifty seven seats in the theatre and the stage is very small but this seems to add to the advancement of the play as the audience begins to feel as isolated and alone as  does. with the actors and audience in such close proximity one must admire the way in which the fight scenes are conducted gracefully yet with a very real element of danger since the audience are essentially in the battle with the characters. the pseudo in the round theatre format also helps to pile the pressure onto the increasingly deteriorating protagonist who seems to become more penned in as the play progressed. the acting is crisp and raw throughout exposing the wounds of each character. kazeem tosin amore and the talented zoë ford who also served as assistant director and producer who played  and lady  respectively were particularly impressive although amore tended to hiss a bit too much which ended up feminizing his character somewhat. the weird sisters scuttle around the stage with such energy that you could not help but be drawn to their powerful glares and wince at their sudden shrieks and repulsive cackles. dan mullins who plays  exudes such a powerful presence it is a real shame that his clarity is sometimes lacking but for the majority of his performance he is largely impressive. the set is bare and there is a very limited use of props apart from swords daggers and the odd basket or rag. while a bare set can often backfire on a production it works well in this instance as the actors are able to take full control of their limited space and offer an enthralling performance to the audience. one draw back of such a small space is that joe sheppards lighting and blacking become an issue. there are times when actors stand at the back wall their faces hidden in darkness or a shadow might be cast against another actor meaning that her facial expressions become hidden from the audience. some other instances include people leaning against two pillars that are awkwardly placed in the space meaning that they are blocked out from to the audience behind them. with the space being so restricted it also means that when the whole cast is on stage it seems far too hectic and busy it is very hard to concentrate on anything that was going on. the use of costumes supervised by sophie westerman is interesting as well. while not distinctly elizabethan they seem to be able to fit in with the time. however  does not look particularly royal despite a small fur draped around his shoulders. neither do the soldiers look overly ready for battle. but being so simplistic it means that there are literally no distractions for the audience who are allowed to concentrate fully on the acting in front of them. there is nothing largely innovative about the production. for the most part it sticks to the narrative of the original play with some words and phrases clearly added in to modernise it slightly. while some other recent productions have attempted to present an ostentatious portrayal of  hiraeth artistic productions kept things simple. but like so many simple things this is very effective. it is an audacious and valiant effort. with resources clearly lacking for the newly established production company they offer a thoroughly enjoyable theatre experience and tackle the daunting prospect of  admirably.,3,Tragedy,Negative
Macbeth,"Roundhouse's Macbeth, Meet Point Break Live!",Barry Eitel, may seem an odd selection for roundhouse productions whose members were involved in a staging of point break live at the new rock theatre a stage version of the keanu reeves vehicle. that cult hit was extended several times. another project at the new rock slated for july is predator the musical. in between these live send ups of dusty blockbuster favorites someone decided to put up some . and they go full throttle casting 35 actors and making only a few judicious cuts to the verse. roundhouses  a play easily messed around with is surprisingly straightforward. in fact i craved more style and imagination i wanted them to leave a  on the text. while there are some kernels of originality they arent fully formed. considering elizabethan drama is a 180 switch from new rocks usual popcorn fodder this  is decent if a bit stodgy. mary reynard liss an experienced lover of the bard according to her bio directs. her imagining of the play is at odds with the companys goofy yet reverent aesthetic. this  feels like a show youd see at some summer festival in a theatre starved midwestern village. its good though somewhat unmemorable but chicago is not lacking theatre or . an excellent production here requires innovation and a clear identifiable voice. roundhouse has fine actors and a ton of them unmuddled storytelling ability and plenty of energy but their  does not have the creative spark needed to justify the production. the show kicks off with a vibrant depiction of the battle between the norwegians and the scots something  makes glancing mentions of but doesnt actually write in. liss and fight designer orion couling stage an impressive full cast brawl. its a multi tiered fight that tells the tale of s victory succinctly and sans dialogue. however not a single sword is swung. lisss concept her most interesting is that swords and other weapons are completely absent from the on stage action. instead the actors mime the fights while combat witches clink swords together to make the appropriate battle noises. the idea is simple bloodless and it works. with the opening war sequence and the anime esque poster art i was hoping that the show would have a comic book feel to it a la qui nguyen. however that isnt the case. once the dialogue starts flowing the comic book conception is tossed away. paula consdorfs workable costumes aim for elizabethan although obviously they couldnt afford complete period attire what storefront theatre company could?. steven hills set provides liss with plenty of levels to stage the action which she does relatively well. hills lights work well although he uses some painfully obvious spotlights to let the audience know when an aside comes along. theres no question lisss production is sophisticated. it requires a myriad of moving parts sometimes to its own detriment. a good fraction of the cast has fewer than five lines. the large cast would be a fascinating factor if liss had staged more crowd scenes but many of her actors spend the majority of the running time backstage. we have a major transition between each scene requiring a black out and some shuffling of set pieces. a couple of these took far too much time than they were worth. a more stripped down approach would work better. the detailed costumes the humongous cast the careful plotting of each set piece it isnt needed. do some double casting and let us in the audience conjure up throne rooms and magic swamps in our heads were smart enough. the lengthy blackouts and period garb make this  static. the performances though are definitely professional caliber. playing the titular scot this s  tybergheins chicago debut. his first few acts are wooden but he livens up as  becomes crazier. lana smithner is far too young to be playing lady  but she does a great job nonetheless. there is chemistry between tyberghein and smithner but the sexual element could be ratcheted up. you can tell s power grabs really get his wife off but whenever the couple has a secret meeting the actors lunge for platonic hugs. honestly we want more making out. cody evanss  is great as is most of the supporting cast. the actors here show a respect for the language a quality unusual for such a young company. the verse is clear and the story makes sense simple yet crucial aspects that are many times ignored. lisss  features some video design some of which is quite effective and disturbing including a visual depiction of the witches prophecy. like much of the show the video is hit or miss and teeters on originality. this show proves roundhouse can do  and they can do it well. now i want to see them do  in the roundhouse way.,3,Tragedy,Negative
Macbeth,The Scottish Play That is All Play,Christopher Adams,is the globes production of  blood lettingly entertaining? a resounding yes. is it also a subtle well acted exploration of fate time and loyalty? not so much. but then subtly may not be what the production has in mind when for example one of the weird sisters drives a spike into the head of the porter. indeed the steps up to the playhouse contain signs that inform the audience please note this is a gruesome production of a brutal play. director lucy baileys  designed by katrina lindsay draws parallels between the globe theatre and the circles of hell. a black stretch fabric tarp is suspended at shoulder level over the yard with holes through which standing audience members can poke their heads. the director credits an image by gustave doré for this idea. at various points throughout the show bloodied bodies spout up from different areas under the tarp causing momentary panic in the audience. the stage is draped in black covering the more opulent decorations for the globes repertory production of henry viii and a large metal ring holding a rotating sheer curtain is suspended above the stage. the curtain seldom used serves as more of a distraction than anything else. numerous trap doors in the stage floor prove a useful space into which bodies are dumped and from which hands writhe a particularly shocking effect occurs when a bloodied  climbs out of a feast laden table. costumes heavy on the use of cowls complete the dark mood with their shades of black grey and midnight blue. and in a reference to the weird sisters as the gatekeepers of hell their costumes are made of the torn uniforms of the globes stewards ie ushers and ticket takers. violence and theatricality dominate. while the text relates many of the murders and executions as second hand accounts baileys production doesnt shrink from showing throat cuttings stabbings biting neck twistings with appropriate bone cracking sound effects and the aforementioned driving of a spike into the porters head. the bodies of  the two allegedly murderous groomsmen and lady  are all dragged onstage and shown to the audience. the violence is mostly for theatrical effect though the production strikes an uncomfortable note in the depiction of the brutal slaughter of lady  and her two children. the stage fighting choreographed by philip dorleans is underscored by the choice of a weighty long blade axe for  not a pretty sight should something go awry but it does make for a thrilling ending battle with . enhancing the time is out of joint feel yes thats  not  is the presence of haunting music composed by  gough. discordant and otherworldly the score employs bagpipes and most unnervingly a didgeridoo which wails like a hellish siren during moments of murder and intrigue. while this show earns accolades for pure entertainment value its treatment of the material is mildly disappointing. elliot cowan as  has a tendency to sink into impossibly elongated ee sounds and enacts much of the middle section of the play in a singsongy tone of voice. by the highly paced final act however he manages to present a believable characterization of a man gone mad. of equal interest is the decision to cast laura rogers as lady . rogers a globe regular slinks onto the stage looking fresh faced and naive as if she accidentally wandered out of a noel coward comedy. in the program notes bailey states that she specifically cast a very young lady  not as a fiend like queen but rather as the sex bomb of scotland. rogers certainly lacks a hard edge and she takes some getting used to but she is ultimately convincing in her portrayal. the weird sisters played by janet fullerlove simone kirby and karen anderson deserve special mention as effective both in their acting and their staging. the entirety of the second prophecy sequence plays as a grotesque carnival. during none of woman born one of the sisters appears to rip a fetus out of another of the sisters causing a spray of liquid into the audience. apart from gross out gags the sisters distribute paper crowns to the patrons reinforcing the sense of s complete inability to father a line of kings. the globes  is not for the weak of stomach as a gore fest it is deliciously bloody and contains enough surprises to induce occasional shrieking. when left to quieter moments however the production falters seemingly waiting for the next gory spectacle to maintain its momentum.,3,Tragedy,Negative
Macbeth,Fire Burn and Trash Can Bubble Macbeth,Michael Meigs,sarah englands opening turn feels just right. shes one witch for three huddled over a trashcan lit from below that sporadically spouts co2 smoke. her cutting voice and spooky moves make you understand that she believes really believes that theres dark magic at work here. this belief is the underpinning of the austin drama club an almost inexplicable group of devotees to the dark art of theatre intent on pondering many a quaint and us volume of forgotten lore. or not so forgotten. adc is in its fourth season under japhy fernandes leadership. now in their quasi hideout on east 7th st. between the texas state cemetery and huston tillotson university they are well into a twelve play season for 2010 both  and not. this production of  is their first of eight major works by . no other theatre in town has a schedule that comes even close to that level of challenge and commitment. an evening with the adc is an eerie and sometimes confusing experience. they run their productions thursdays saturdays three weekends per month in a frame house stocked with a miscellany of chairs arranged in makeshift multiple level seating. its dark in there. the house seats up to 35 but i havent seen more than about 20. this is a word of mouth world. the adc core is willing to share their experience only with those who are really really interested in seeking them out. after puzzling at this ive begun to think that they dont really need an audience. theyre pleased to have you there but theyre not hustling to have you other than putting up a few homemade posters and now passing along some information to an austin theatre website. no one is hawking soft drinks or wine in return for a suggested contribution and they dont do much to point out the tip jar in the entry behind the kitchen. company members must be getting their charge from the texts and from the comradeship of rehearsals and performances. their approach is respectful but not reverent. last fall director julio mella set his richard iii in a warner brothers gangster world. japhy fernandes sets their current  in a vaguely contemporary time in which scottish lords carry golf clubs and automatic pistols. tartans and chequered sweaters are much in evidence. fernandes cuts the text both to the measure of the ten person company and in order to speed the delivery while retaining the essential elements and conventional interpretations of the characters. as in any self identified group of fanatics theres a range of abilities. fernandes as  has good command of his  and his character. russell shugart as  is solid well spoken appropriately indignant and heroic. christopher harris is lean and mean in the ensemble as ross as a murderer and as the porter. java as the hapless  scarcely escapes from cartoon cliché for whenever hes pensive he rubs his chin in doleful reflection and when hes surprised he throws up his hands and his mouth goes to a silent o this is just what  warned his players against. india raney gets into the role of lady  with girlish glee rather than ambition or gravitas. young thatcher fernandes and his mom ellen are effective as s doomed family. despite his tender age and slight frame thatcher does an impressive hobgobliny turn as the crook backed witch e. the austin drama club is testimony that someone somewhere will always be doing s work. their next invocation will be of richard iii in april. now its up to you to sleuth them out.,2,Tragedy,Negative
Macbeth,Chase Your Doom at Sleep No More,Deirdre Yee,punchdrunk theatre companys american debut sleep no more is a constructed reality that affects every part of your body a sensual experience that excites and unnerves like a foreboding shiver running down your spine. its an interactive performance that reaches its most subtle and stirring potential leaving the audience to alternate between chasing actors down darkened hallways following them into their despair and madness and freezing in horror when they turn their hollow eyes upon you. audience members are admitted into the old lincoln school one by one pointed through a curtain and left in a pitch black maze. the pressing darkness breaks at each turn by flickering lights. a series of turns brings you to another curtain where a flapper at manderlay bar greets you. you must then wait your turn to be called into the performance hidden behind one final curtain. once inside this nuanced sensory experience will make you feel like youre watching a movie from within the action trespassing on private moments transfixed breathless and deeply invested in the world spiraling around you. the other 300 audience members who wander the grounds become part of the experience. silent and faceless were hidden behind shocking white masks that reduce us to a pair of wide eyes that pierce into the s literalizing the crushing gaze of judgment that eats away at this murderous couple. beams of light isolate objects and actors in otherwise dimly lit rooms. the low sinister drone of music more david lynch than alfred hitchcock creeps by and the sudden deafening crunch of the unseen gravel beneath your feet joins the accompanying soundtrack of echoing footsteps sharp intakes of breath and the high penetrating cackle of a witch streaking down the hallway. at times the sensual nature of sleep no more almost overwhelms. the first scene takes you to a long room packed with pungent christmas trees and dry ice dark save for a murky blue light that cuts across a twisting and writhing woman dancing alone in the center of the floor. e played by careena melia dances in frightening and beautiful motion interpreting the low guttural music that fills the room. the bass is so loud that it shakes the floor and your insides leaving you and your senses unsteady and dazed. the drive to chase after the actors is split with the desire to examine the amazing art installations that cover this abandoned school building. we experience the chill of déjà vu as we enter a room almost identical another but twisted slightly and corrupted by the horrors seen in the banquet hall and in s bedroom. we stumble upon a dead bird a set of wrapped boxes in a perambulator abandoned in the hallway a telephone illuminated from above a line of bathtubs uniform except for the tint of red staining the water. the acting and dancing are exuberant and would have tended towards being over the top if it werent for the fact that their faces and bodies tell the whole story assisted by sound and set design but never by dialogue. the performers silence amplifies the moments when they sign groan or cry out and is instrumental to the atmosphere. this is the second production in the american repertory theaters  exploded festival and one of the things this company seems to be expelling from of their adaptations is every syllable of s language. from the 70s disco lyrics and banter that voice the midsummer nights antics in arts previous production of the donkey show to the suspenseful tendrils of music that narrate s murder of sleep the total exclusion of the bards words seems excessive. the discovered adventure theater of sleep no more utilizes silence to enhance suspense and could not support full dialogue as more than half of the audience would miss most of the lines. however a solitary line or two uttered in each scene perhaps whispered and half heard by the actors stalking audience could marry the genius of s language with the stunning art and acting that surrounds us. punchdrunk theater company and the american repertory theater have successfully yanked the audience into an intimate acquaintance with the human weaknesses that wreck havoc in . robert mcneill as  and hector harkness as  terrify and enthrall audience members who witness the suspicions cast after s murder. in a captivating performance mcneill and harkness fire accusations with a swinging light that they thrust at one other in a deadly arch of violence rage and grief. similarly electric and dangerous is the fight between geir hytten  and vinicius salles . their movements are a tight grasping dance a physical poetry that shows their emotional connection as friend murders friend. we know that no one is innocent and no one will be spared. the sense of doom is all encompassing and leaves little room for anything else. even while capturing the essence of s role as a christ figure the son whose restoration to the throne will right the s corruption of time and restore the line of kings it is a sinister deity we perceive at this last supper. salvation has been inverted sin and debauchery overpower us all when even  is drawn into the hellish orgy at s banquet. if there were rooms or characters or even moments that offered access to a lighter world for a spell would it be more jarring to watch lady  sarah dowling as her guilt ridden gnarled blood stained hands lead her to contortions of self revulsion? but perhaps the dread is what keeps us captivated and rooted to the spot. sleep no more will heighten your senses and leave your mind reeling replaying moments of the night. the paths you chose to go down and the doors you open along the way will follow you home and the ones you left untouched will haunt you. every audience members experience is unique and infused with a sense of freedom and privileged anonymity and the illicit intrusion into the minds of the characters is thrilling. chasing ghosts through the night is an exhilarating and tiring experience. wear sneakers check your coat and be prepared to dive into your dread to see what you can discover. perhaps you too will choose to chase  until the last moment of the night cower under his bloody glare and consequently endure being accosted by the ghost of . before releasing me into the outside world  pressed a keepsake into my hand to keep the shivers going. a small charm a heart with a knife plunging through it on a thin blood red thread. not for the faint of heart or mind sleep no more will crawl under your skin and stay there.

Macbeth,Prophesy Points to Possibilities in the Scottish Play,Denise Battista,australian director gale edwards is working her way through s canon and after twenty years of direction in the us and abroad edwards delivers a dark yet forward thinking production of the scottish play that tries to focus on the inner turmoil and choices of  as well as the cyclical generational choices of humanity with images of a war torn state ravaged by ambition and the conscious decision to be or not to be plagued by the power of a prophetic past.scott bradleys set design both helps and hinders this production. molten rock smolders around the perimeter of the dark and eerie stage holding a grandiose staircase that swirls up and off stage right. this decadence is merely an illusion however as its foundation is a cracked and tumbling pile of rubble resembling a collapsed bridge or overpass. the staircase maintains its structure by only threads of stability and the intricate wrought iron railings are increasingly deformed the higher one ascends. metaphors abound likening the cracked foundation the seeming beauty of the golden railings and the molten rock to images of a broken political and moral state the sometimes deceitful nature of success and how ambition may lead one to spiral into the heights of oblivion or into the pits of hell. while the cast gets quite a workout flying up and down the staircase the design seems to leave the actors stranded front and center delivering lines too much to the audience rather than permitting us to engage in any sort of dramatic action or interchange. connecting with the audience is fine for soliloquies and asides but in this production it lessens interaction and believability between the actors turning drama into a sporadic series of one man shows.in his second season at osf  macon takes the role of  but he never seems to take it far enough. if macon is compensating for going a quarter step too far last season as  a show of brilliance by this measuring stick id say its time to shake it off and let the scorpions rage because in order to connect with  as a man overcome by the pressures and poisons of ambition perhaps as a willing victim of prophesy and as a detrimental result of the conscious decisions he makes we must first connect with him on a human level. otherwise  is just a villain visible as a spectacle of otherness rather than as a mirror of omens. macon shows glints of passion and opens up considerably after losing his wife in the second act but he sometimes seems to be running lines and going through motions rather than inviting us on his journey. with an invitation like this how can we care about him in the end or throughout?we do care about his wife. robin goodrin nordli is strong seductive and villainous and a freudian dream as she inevitably cracks under the pressures of her own conscience ending any brief candle of mediation between superego and id. before crumbling into an incessant obsession of hand washing lady  is part of the haves decked out in one amazing red gown after another bedecked in rubies given by the unassuming  james j. peck and confident in her female prowess and undaunted mettle. costume designer murrell horton uses a dark palate of various fabrics and textures in this production splashed with blood red and military uniforms. horton introduces  to disney when lady becomes queen likening nordli a little too much to snow whites wicked royalty once she and her husband take the scottish reins however nordli holds no apple and never falters even if her character inevitably does. nordli saves many a scene from falling flat including a relatively anticlimactic banquet scene that pits  and the bloody  rex young against one another on the casket like banquet table with youngs rumble fish gestures evoking more snickers than fear.edwards plays some interesting tricks with the witches. robynn rodriguez perri gaffney and k.t. vogt are ghoulish with hair hearkening back to the powdered wigs of the 18th century granted after spending time in hell. their blackened eyes and hollowed faces are even more harrowing due to  mcculloughs brilliant lighting design that glows from below. the same lighting affect underscores nordli as she prepares for her husbands return from the field conjuring spirits for his ear while reading his letter. it also draws an indirect connection between the witches and the lady. this production emphasizes the power of the next generation and the lack there of as is the case with s barren scepter and with the murder of all of s pretty ones. edwards offers the audience not three but six witches including a young trio of silent conjurers perhaps blurring the line between past present and future but their presence is an overall question  as to their relevance in the play. this aside edwards leaves the audience screaming and gasping for air when they get a taste of whats inside the witches cauldron. if these grotesque garbage pail kid apparitions dont get your heart racing nothing will.kevin kenerly as  delivers a heartbreaking scene upon learning that his wife and children have been slaughtered. s words are painful and vivid and kenerly apprehends every emotion as he mourns and regrets his loss. kenerly gives us a man with honor integrity pride in his country and depths of emotion before giving scotland a hero in the end of the play. he also offers the most human characterization on this stage and for that he evokes tears.without changing s play edwards includes a subtle nod to the witches early prophesy that   shalt get kings though thou be none. it is thought that  offered many a nod to his king and patron james i of england previously james vi of scotland who was said to be a direct descendant of the real . this theory was disproven in the 19th century and the actual existence of an historical  is also questioned but not until well after  presented his play in the early years of king james rule. edwards explores what may have been s intentions and in effect leaves the ending of the play open to a sequel that  never wrote. this conspiracy involves the witches and s surviving son  nikolas horaites who in effect gets more stage time for the sake of recognition. it also explores a provocative question about authorial intent and opens up a play like  that for many has a set

Macbeth,Fashion Over Form: Macbeth Strikes a Pose,Denise Battista,the scottish play has certainly made its rounds this year and understandably so.  is a play that deals with among a slew of other things personal and political ambition uncertain times an affected state of the union and the fallibility and corruptibility of those who lead. the doublespeak circulating in the words fair is foul and foul is fair creates an unreliable atmosphere of mistrust while deconstructing the very grounds on which we think we stand. these are big important potent virile themes that forcefully make a statement and pack a punch.  jacksons production of  is prefaced by a barrage of statements linking political ambition to the glitz and glamor of the haves versus have nots and the swinish poseurs who look pretty good in lipstick. but like much of the media hype out there these are unfortunate rumors about a production that fails to make clear contact with its target unless of course the points here are to advertise some pretty spectacular couture clothing from costume sponsor foley and bonny and for me to despise these scots because i cant begin to afford lady s fabulous collection of shoes.this production doesnt completely lack intrigue. nina balls set design less the ceiling to floor gold metallic column streaming the backdrop proves genius although this touch of greatness is not realized until the final scene of the production when the fashion show inspired thrust stage literally opens and the sharpened trunks of birnam wood penetrate the house. the measure is violent and pulled off well by the cast who manually crack open the stage for this spectacular finish. sound and lighting design by sarah huddleston and jon tracy respectively are bold and dramatic with low long rumbling tones vibrating scenes of anticipatory gore. but a tendency of these two to spotlight and dramatically hone in on s soliloquies and asides ridiculously deflates these moments and evokes recurring laughter from the audience.expertly placed blood pellets are abundant and murders are blatant sometimes to the good of the production and sometimes not so much. the murder of  daniel duque estrada and  cassady bogatin is swift and cold and all the more horrible due to the actors portrayal of an endearing familial bond. duque estrada delivers a fine  both alive and dead. but the murder of   mercer which encourages the imagination to conjure a scene that is just too horrible to show by typically occurring offstage is poorly staged and awkwardly visible imbruing comedy or perhaps confusing himself with hal in henry iv part ii when craig er as  removes and replaces the crown on mercers head before mercers drawn out death scene which is perhaps suitable for pyramus but bordering on asinine here. and for all the blood and blatant gore in this production one expects to see something in s murder of  but alas it occurs offstage and proves stunted.this cast is stiff with x s the spot posing on the catwalk in a seeming attempt to show that their trousers have roomy pockets or their briefcases are of fine leather versus moving and feeling with the language and weighty import of this play. granted its important to make certain you dont get any theatrical blood on your 1500 hickey freeman suit but this is not the place for fashion over form. there are some happy exceptions. blythe fosters show saving portrayal of lady  is sexy and stunning and even though lady  is a villain fosters mad scene is heartbreaking. foster has no problem whatsoever with showing some skin and sometimes perhaps shows more than even shes aware as she thankfully shies away from x s the spot blocking her youthful body writhing on the stage in her flimsy lingerie.zehra berkman portrays three witches in an electrifying one well dressed as a homeless vagrant with a plastic water bottle for a cauldron which she uses to possess and conjure fosters soul to deliver apparitions to . this production could have used a bit more of berkmans presence however to link her spiritual guidance to s ambitious intents. berkman also serves as the well shoed lady  showing she has a good sense of humor as the porter speaks of lechery and the lack thereof. this is in dire contrast to   ruocco whose flaccid oh horror horror horror and o scotland scotland are anticlimactic at best. some lesser roles are well delivered by reid davis as the porter and kevin clarke who opens the play as a most disturbing bloody sergeant and penetrates his later scenes as s right hand murdering man.there are lots of pretty people on this stage. pretty people wearing pretty clothing. s armor is leather with a sexy bit of lacing up the rear of his pants. daniel bruno ross and daniel krueger  show their sponsors collection of black business suits complete with briefcases always and for no apparent reason in hand. lady  wears a long plum gown and some smashing black patent leather sling back pumps during the banquet scene turn cocktail party and i still cant get her introductory ankle boots out of my head. even the obviously pregnant lady  sports three inch chunky brown pumps. thats a feat in itself. and theres s flashy purple shirt and the porters snazzy jacket. i could go on but i almost forgot this is a theatre review not a write up for vogue magazine.,3,Tragedy,Negative
Macbeth,Macbeth in Japan? Too Cool.,Matthew Barbot,the first challenge in adapting  to a japanese setting would be immediately apparent to most bardolators and film students alike it must work hard not to just be throne of blood. the challenge of any reviewer sent to see such a production is similar he must work hard not to constantly compare it to throne of blood.  r. briggs must have known comons would be inevitable when he set about writing his adaptation shogun  but he has succeeded in creating a show that stands on its own.unlike kurosawas masterpiece briggs play seeks not only to preserve the story of  but the text as well bringing us s story of unchecked ambition and righteous vengeance transposed on feudal japan. the pan asian repertorys production of shogun  wins points for the exotic with its beautiful costumes and impressive set dominated by a buddhist shrine but it falls down where many adaptations do in that it never fully explores its new setting to see what it may uncover. too often briggs seems to settle for word substitution while royal titles and place names are necessary changes might it not make more sense to change the names of the characters to japanese counterparts before bothering to replace the word dagger with shoto a japanese short sword? did warriors in feudal japan not use daggers and does their word for them not roughly translate to welldagger? the use of the word katana however is effective because of the reverence attached to this particular weapon its not just any sword. replacing god and lord with buddha and heaven with nirvana is more problematic in that these buddhist concepts differ from the christian ones theyre standing in for in substantial enough ways to not always make sense in context and once again seem like they were written in for the sake of making the play sound japanese rather than any thematic reason.in a play already so much about honor and loyalty i am disappointed that the sheer depth of s crime is not examined through a japanese lens. to have  kill his shogun in a society where the death of a shogun often means the ritual suicide of the samurai who serves him opens up wonderful opportunities to explore the anathema attached to his betrayal betrayal is bad in scotland sure but its unthinkable in japan. unfortunately this particular production often shies away from deeper cultural exploration.this is a shame because there are a number of places where the production does make wonderful use of its setting. the codified body language of the japanese court does a lot of work in the way of expressing how characters feel about one another the fear and respect one character has for another in any given moment is vividly shown in how low he bows or whether he merely takes a knee or goes to all fours. this is used to greatest effect with  and his wife their shows of respect and deference often cover their true meanings or motives and the moments when fujin lady s played by the enthralling roseanne ma cutting words are at odds with her demure affectations are electrifying to watch. the witches have become the yojos of kabuki theatre and under ernest abubas direction they seem to inhabit a world governed by kabukis conventions. when fujin  invokes their power for her first monologue as well as her sleepwalking scene she enters fully into this world immersing herself in kabukis stylized movements. in the plays most chillingly effective scene she delivers her sleepwalking speech eyes rolled back with a white streak in her hair. we can see in her face and her motions that she has left this reality behind. this separation between the material and the spirit worlds one that exists stylistically even when the two worlds share the stage and interact serves to underscore the supernatural elements of  in striking ways. lastlywhile s text has been abridged scenes are framed with appearances by an elderly storyteller imparting the audience with relevant wisdom and parables a choice that makes us look at  as a fairy tale and a fable we should not be content merely to hear the play but should leave the theater with its lessons.kaipo schwabs  is at his best when he is restrained early on his ranting and raving gets in the way of the characters descent if  is routinely out of control the moments where he is seen to be slipping lose their potency. i said i wouldnt make any throne of blood comons but i will here the beauty of toshiro mifunes performance in the film is the sense one gets that he is constantly struggling against his rage though it escapes him from time to time. as such schwab seems more able to channel mifunes brilliance in his quieter moments where his mania bubbles just below a veneer of control. its when hes loud that he merely seems at times to be doing a toshiro mifune impression trade grimace and all. by the time he reaches tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow however schwab is in top form. the supporting cast is uniformly solid particularly ariel estradas  and e. calvin ahns . keoni scotts  is lovely and endearing but his accent gets in the way of his speeches at times. i admit this has more to do with my ear than his acting but that in mind perhaps the director could have done more to compensate for the sake of those like me.overall while i think the pan asian repertorys production of shogun  could have gone farther thats only because the production shines in those places where it does dare to push the envelope and try new things. there is certainly more good than mediocre and the allure of setting  in feudal japan cannot be denied which the impressive fight choreography unquestionably demonstrates. its a worthy exercise to be sure and where it succeeds it does so in spades. still with kurosawas film as a proof of concept this production could have taken more risks with the material.,4,Tragedy,Positive
Macbeth,One Hundred Minutes of the Beautifully Horrible,Roseanne Wells,in the small black box theater the upstage wall slides apart as the softly dreary lights rise underlined by vaguely familiar music that recalls chilly northern britain. gentle fog frames three women emerging in shapeless brown dresses echoing each others whispers. these witches are eerie primal but innocently sexy. with this opening director james phillip gates and the roust theatre company set the scene for their violent lusty sexy powerful and bloody production of . the artistry involved in creating this scotland is impressive supporting the actors without overpowering their work. casey smith has designed an invisibly effortless stage functionally breaking down into different scenes as bench becomes bed bed becomes platform and platform becomes the bench again. michael bogdens sound choices evoke a dark and powerful atmosphere slowly passing into the audiences consciousness serpentine rattling and haunting jangly strings in the scenes preceding s murder the shrieking yet indistinct siren for the dagger soliloquy and the clicking of dusty film reels between scenes of battle. heather klars costume design transforms the actor into lady  as well as the character into the publicly regal lady  from sexy red hostess dress to a more dignified black gown as queen. she dresses the men in mostly strong dashing suits complementing the modern but timeless world of gentlemen where they play battle on a chessboard but still play for keeps for honor fealty and power. the actors build from the text a world where sexual violence and violent sex are applauded rewarded and even interchanged where it is completely justified for the future prince to rip out a traitors teeth before cutting his throat and where lady  dominates her husband as she grinds on his pelvis and his will power. this commendable troupe even manages to pull out some genuine comedic moments in the middle of one of s great tragedies. speaking with strong physical commitment and articulate modern voices for good or ill whichever pleases these actors do not let  and his lady rule this ensemble piece. tracy hostmyers lady  grows as the performance progresses starting steady and gradually tipping the scales toward insane. adapting a deeper smoothing voice hostmyer dominates and protects her  instructing while she condescends and humors him. she is implicated as a witch or a witch like practitioner when she surrounds herself in a circle of special powder in preparation for her unsex me here soliloquy. more context from the production elements are needed however so her epileptic fits of supernatural power seem less schizophrenic and more a conduit of the paranormal. but more powerful is when lady  stands before us in act v naked in the shreds of her tissue thin nightdress perfectly exposed in washing off her obsessive guilt as she sleeps. in the banquet scene we see her attempts to comfort the lords and cover her husbands embarrassing psychotic episodes while trey zieglers  reaches his emotional climax and breaking point. as a bloody banged up   pifko interrupts lady s stately dinner party which to be fair he is supposed to attend anyway her husbands mind visibly turns away from any consolation and cs the rubicon into the beginning of madness. he meets the weird sisters again and they have morphed into suppliant sex goddesses bent on pleasing  and themselves in a foursome but he hardly notices. even among the sadomasochistic witches in black tutus  is more attentive almost obsessed with the demonic prophesy voice over dictating his future only thrusting and gyrating as an afterthought.  is s character foil meant to be seen as the upstanding scot who puts the proper king on the throne and who even flees the country to protect himself as the future victor over . but witnessing the plundering of s castle in his absence blurs this assumed black and white contrast increasing his grieving sorrow and regret for his transgression while providing even more motivation for revenge. pregnant lady  kristin barnett watches her son who is played as special needs by tom macy murdered while she is raped and penetrated with a knife from behind before her own throat is cut. her entire body taut with anger and fear and victimization shows her outrage and vulnerability for having no capable soldier to save her son her future child or herself. i could do nothing but stare. duane boutte plays the good hearted and repentant sinner  well seething quietly with outbursts calling for vengeance while his sins weigh heavily on his soul.  isaac woofter also presents a more nuanced character than taken at first glance highlighted by the productions spin. from torturing prisoners with unmedicated teeth extraction flirting with lady  consciously manipulating  in his hour of least resolve and literally bedding the weird sisters in a repeat foursome  doesnt appear as an improvement to  he is just without the ambitious woman leeching from his power. in this horrendous an world abridged by modern attention span the roust theatre company keeps its passion for theater clear and projects more than just wonderful verse.,4,Tragedy,Positive
Macbeth,Unsex Me Here,Jack Morgan,directors seem to face difficulty when attempting to make productions of  theatrically interesting trying all sorts of things to get audiences notice them. i have seen s set in the melbourne criminal underground a soviet era someplace with a crotchety patrick stewart a civil war era fort under the golden gate bridge and i even played  in a production in which all of the roles were switched in the middle from male to female performers. audiences notice these loud directorial decisions and like to talk about how interesting or not they are. the all female company womans will guided by founding artistic director erin merritt bewitches with the power of the witches but this production leaves audiences most spellbound with a well done lady . the play revolves around the lady shes arguably the most recognizable female character in all of drama. despite wills promotional insistence that the witches are the most impressive attribute of this production it is lady  played by leontyne mbele mbong who also taking on at least seven other roles in this production leaves her audience wanting more. i dont mean to suggest that the witches arent at all impressive. being nothing more than shadows and voices in this production they are incredibly effective and the actors make sure that their presence is felt in every moment of the action. when only five people are playing all of the parts it would normally prove challenging to embody more than one character at any given time but the cast does it seamlessly and effortlessly. although it is difficult to play more than one part in any production it is decidedly more difficult to play those parts with pieces of characters always present in one another and on top of that without losing the audience. this production is not confusing for a second and that lack can be embraced with pride. okay maybe just for one second. this production at times uses unnecessary video effects when the cast has obviously developed a graceful adroitness when it comes to doing cool things with light and shadow. the shadow witches are wonderful and eerie but when  approaches the audience and  as a projected video loop of a default effect on the same screen the audience is too busy judging the merits of the directors av editing skills rather than paying attention to s ghost. any shadow would have done better and since we and the actors are used to shadow play at this point it would have blended quite nicely. the night i saw womans will perform  was one of the last nights at the jack london square retail theater space before the troupe moves on to a brief run at san s exit theatre. jls retail theater space is really just a vacant storefront. i say just because it is thrilling to see scotland come to life there. lighting designer stephanie buchner and costume designer tammy berlin had their work cut out for them but both really come through with a simple but effective strategy. minimalism and adaptability is the name of this game and every measure of the black slacks and white shirts are used to create a character. set designer jacquelyn scott turns the sparse space into a theater creating wings on a nonexistent stage and making the backstage area disappear by turning our attention to it as often as possible. so elegantly done is the set design that the big awkward wall in the center of the room playing birnam wood england and dunsinane becomes all of those places all on its own. heres an instance where wall really does have a part in the play. and i love how close that wall comes to being ineffective and how dangerous it was to do it that way. but the women of womans will seem to like to do things dangerously. anytime a  production has an all male or all female cast it is in danger of becoming a parlor trick. men playing  or cleopatra are almost always cheap because they end up mere parodies of the characters and women in general. its no different when women play male characters. the only thing that is often accomplished by gender bending on the stage is to show how little we know about each other. men play women coy and effeminate women are almost never coy and effeminate and women play men chesty and macho most men have hopefully learned machismo gets them nowhere. womans will doesnt mess around like that. the production crew includes a movement coach lauren steinter scout who must be very good. these women are some of the most talented actors ive seen because they not only speak like men but also moved like them. when leontyne mbele mbong plays a male role she is totally believable and as lady  she is noticeably different more womanly but not cliché or camp. they dont make a joke about the fact that they are women playing men and the audience forgets it almost immediately. the production is neither parody nor gimmick. all in all its a pretty straight production and a straight production is really hard to do when youve only got five women playing all the parts. but they do it and its a testament to what this little fearless troupe is all about.,4,Tragedy,Positive
Macbeth,Fort Point Finally Sees Battle in a Monumental Macbeth,Denise Battista,in this case  the plays not everything. the we players whose motto is to present site specific performance events that transform public spaces into realms of participatory theater present yet another maxim location location location. granted first choice for a production of the scottish play might be in scotland perhaps on dunsinane hill although the two forts at this point are in ruins. on a voluntary budget and a two weekend run with pass the hat post show price of admission complete with tea and cookies its hard to believe the we players would perform at arguably the second best place on earth or at least the first best in the san  bay area. artistic director ava roy began talks with the u.s. national parks service in november 2007 about staging a production of  inside the brick and mortar civil war era fort at san s fort point. constructed between 1853 and 1861 in an effort to secure the san  bay from an anticipated attack that never came the fort finally and after much effort became a national historic site in 1970 opening its doors to the public offering its amazing historic value and imposing architectural design of three casemated tiers and a top barbette tier seated just below the south entrance to the golden gate bridge. this three hour production under the direction of ava roy cara defabio and randall cohn is led by three guides jack halton nathan harper and our mighty enthusiastic red haired blue eyed guide kate mcknightly. the guides also take on the roles of  nurse and doctor simultaneously while leading their sometimes separate groups of thirty five give or take through the fort. so how does this all work? i deserve applause if i can put it into words. all patrons begin the show together entering the fort through the steel doors and into the cold and blustery ground floor arena. the first few scenes are performed for the group and then under the direction of our respective guides we break off and updownaroundthrough one of the multiple pathways in this space for one of three possible adaptations of the next scene. a total of nine players take on all the roles in the play each actor playing and exchanging each and every part at some point aside from the witches roles which remain static. this break offreconvene method occurs throughout the production in a surprisingly structured and workable manner and at times when say each group needs to convene in a particular room for a scene but must do so separately for the sake of space each of the three groups will see a different scene granted slightly out of s order and rotate till weve all seen what we need to see and are ready to reconvene again. phew this is an interactive and by all means active show. there are no chairs theres no need as the audience moves round the fort just as much as the actors do. theres also not much insofar as set design aside from a banquet table for s ghost and a heath in the center of the grounds piled high with bones and beans bricks and branches the latter becoming that ever so moving scene of birnam wood. these players use and work with their already established environment monopolizing on its design that seems to have been made for this show. sara nelsons costume design is civil war military dress and includes color coded sashes green for  blue for  etc. in a successful although likely unnecessary attempt to avert confusion when say were on our third actor playing  lady  or another. lady  is recognizable by her long skirt and a subtle yet bold snapping red fan. the roles are not gender specific meaning both male and female actors cover all. there are standouts among the actors. roy multitasks as artistic director co director and first witch. the three sisters roy cara defabio and sarah scharf work well together whether looming above the action on the third tier of the fort or conjuring in a double double toil and tumble moment offering some interesting acrobatic moves without much trouble to create a mostly fluid synergy through movement but its roy who keeps the three in tune. on the occasions when the sisters must vanish as per the scene their exit is creative and effective achieved by a silent poof as they toss their sashes into the air before dashing off scene or later in a simultaneous drop and roll toward the heath their bodies melding with the mound of debris. val sinkler at least insofar as my group was concerned is most memorable in her roles as  and lady  exuding power and pain passion and lust deviance and defeat delivered throughout with the strength and stability of one very fine actor who has mastered the art of quick change. for sinklers stability its dhira rauch who leaves the audience on the edges of their nonexistent seats with her unstable and irrational behavior and i mean this in a good way. rauch is the sole portrayer of the porter and her delivery is diabolical vulgar and vastly entertaining. her presence like that of sinklers is always welcome. rauchs scene as lady  is violent filled with kicking and screaming the bloody scene created by red lighting. the same affect is attempted earlier in the production as our guides take us for a questionable viewing of king s death chamber. its tough to outdo or even come close to s description of this bloody scene that  determined to keep offstage so to reenact it with a walk by viewing proves somewhat anti climactic though a bold directorial move that works to keep the audience an intimate part of the production. lighting is for the most part natural aside from some small bulbs lining the spiral staircases for the sake of ones life. as the night embraces this vast stage natural lighting lacks in some of the chambers and leaves some scenes in the dark. roy explained that the troupe was originally to have civil war lanterns in the production but for some reason or another the lanterns never came through. as the sun went down and the winds blew an even colder air on this performance scenes within the many chambers were welcomed but for want of light not all were fully realized. theres so much to say about this production. theres a three piece civil war band trumpeting a bugle a bagpipe and timpani an instrument that has evolved from ceremonial and military drum to orchestral over the past nine hundred years. as the audience dashes as fast as they can up the spiraling staircases and to the third tier of the fort for s right out of the movies fight to his death with  and  seen dueling in far away silhouette against the backdrop of a violent san  sky the timpani beats wildly in competition with the waves crashing below and the cars thundering above keeping the momentum as we travel from scene to scene. this production stages an interactive banquet scene setting up a forty foot table within the fort while the audience is busy watching another scene elsewhere the table holding a surprising feast for audience and actors alike feasting taking place as sinklers  raves over s ghost. in another behind the scenes attempt the audience of spectators is led through a line of several chambers posing as rooms within the  household each room oozing the insanity that infects lady . in chamber one a witch counts beans. chamber two sweeps feathers. chamber three is lady s dressing chamber holding scattered fans and intimates leading to the next chamber holding the lady herself obviously distraught and tormented though silent. the final chamber carries the low hollow and sometimes grumbling howl of a prayer bowl the circular motion used to create this tone reminiscent of the witches conjuring in previous scenes. this asylum sort of feel works well with the notion of personalities splitting in this production be they split by the literal fact that many actors play each part or during the scene in which a slew of lady s appear above the audience in an eerie moment of hand rubbing and spots that are damned. and theres so much more. so much more that really should be seen by bay area audiences but alas for the last eight years ava roy has been committed to providing accessible although not ada in this case free theatre to the community with the help of donors and the generosity of volunteer actors and conceivers. this production of  runs for two weekends only and each showing is completely booked two weeks not because of desire to and for the show to go on but two weeks because thats when the funds run out. my advice to roy charge. you should not only because you can because this show is just that exciting but because more people need to know who you are and what you do. a show like this could run open and book throughout.,5,Tragedy,Positive
Macbeth,Macbeth Proves Tricky at the Folger,Georgina Petronella,the folger theatres production of  starts off with a murder. not just any murder mind you but the gory knifing of the house manager who prettily reels off announcements onstage. she doesnt quite get to finish telling us to turn off our cell phones though because a wolfish troop of leering warriors surrounds and guts her.heh.its that kind of show. aaron posners directors note says that this production is an attempt to restore some of the fun to s classic and it shows. posner has a high profile co director in emmy winning magician teller the quieter half of the vegas act penn  teller and the two of them manage to pull off some pretty cool magic tricks. characters vanish into thin air reappear suddenly dripping in blood clutch at daggers hovering inside mirrors and sword fight with considerable dexterity. and the fight choreography is pretty impressive considering the intimacy of the space. is a play surrounded by an almost supernatural level of superstition. actors refuse to name it while inside a theater preferring to call it the scottish play or mackers. perhaps these superstitions are not unfounded when i saw the show the actors had to back up and restart after a technical hiccup at the start of the night. but after that the show ran smoothly as we followed the chilling tale of  and his murderous quest for the throne.ian merrill peakes and kate eastwood norris lead the cast as  and his lady. peakes is excellent in the title role his  starts off tough and assured and then swaggers into madness. his sense of humor grows in proportion to his insanity. peakes embodies the notion of acting as reacting his best moments come when he silently responds to another actor. norris a local favorite seems a bit of an odd choice for the scheming lady m. norris usually gets cast in comedic or quirky parts here too she wrings all the humor from the role. its the heavier stuff that presents the problem. her unsex me here soliloquy is underwhelming but she gets better as the night goes on. i was with her completely by the time she got to the out damn spot speech. the rest of the cast is fine with cody nickell as  getting in a few good moments. there are also three child actors in the cast they fare much better than young actors usually do when presented with . but really it is peakes show.the set design by daniel conway is a two level rusty contraption with a set of giant gates commanding most of the attention. the lights by thom weaver are harsh and unforgiving and used to sickly success with the rendering of s ghost. the sound design by karin graybash features a lot of creaking noises and one live hidden percussionist. every time the side doors shut for example they are accompanied by a bellowing note from somewhere backstage. less effective is the costume design by devon painter. there are a lot of kilts we are in scotland after all accompanied by a bevy of cut off sweaters and motorcycle jackets. the whole skirted effect is oddly reminiscent of the lord of the rings movies and honestly kind of silly. the three grotesque witches are played by men so maybe there is some sort of gender commentary buried underneath the monkey business. the witches by the way get the best scene of the night. they roar and grunt and heave and sway as they toss eye of newt and toe of frog into a giant cauldron toiling and troubling to great lively effect.for all of the magic though the creepiest moment of the night has nothing to do with sleight of hand. s tiny son gets murdered onstage and the directors to their credit dont try to jazz it up. they simply have the murderer snuff this brief candle out and drag his almost weightless little body away carelessly as one might tow a pillow. that was one minute in this otherwise morbidly amusing  that didnt seem funny in the slightest.,4,Tragedy,Positive
Macbeth,Fate Proves Overpowering in Goold's Bloody Macbeth,Denise Battista,bloody and gorrific rupert goold leaves his audience with images to remember. he also tempts fate just a little in his modernist technologically inclined stalin and so much more inspired production of the scottish play storming the stage at the brooklyn academy of music after successfully sold out runs and reviews at the chichester festival theatre and londons gielgud theatre. goold is touted as the hottest director in town whatever the town and his acclaim is not at all hindered by inviting heavy hitterbig name patrick stewart to be his leading man. stewart who had an admirable career in the theatre before becoming captain of the starship enterprise for seven years 1987 1994 got that itch for an theatre again in 2004. now at age 67 stewart has mesmerized audiences with his 2006 starring role in goolds rsc production of the tempest and now as  stewart battles a fate stronger than any romulan. that fate is his own. goold sets his production in the soviet era drumming up even more emphasis on elements of paranoia already native to the play. christine rowlands costuming is mostly military apropos save the standout presence of kate fleetwood who dresses her lady  in silken robes elegant gowns or fitted garb and seduction throughout the greater part of the play. set designer  ward creates a sterile stage at first we have a hospital ward that gurneys the bloody and seizing opening screams of the bloody sergeant hywel  who reports on s victories while his life and death are projected on the stage walls by way of a heartbeat monitor. hospital ward turns industrial kitchen with white tile walls and an abrupt coldness that serve to highlight the additional gushes of blood throughout the play. video and production design by lorna heavey plays a large part on this stage whether for instance calling up the bloody elevator in the shining during goolds ingenious banquet scenes or running grotesque cartoons that feature eyeballs after eyeballs on a television that sits atop a refrigerator back stage left. its very orwellian or perhaps it draws upon stalins nkvd secret police. goold also gives a nod to the 2006 oscar winner the lives of others with this notion of being watched and in a clever interpretation of the interrogation scene between ross tim treloar and   rawlings during which you half expect the whimpering treloar to place his hands face down under his thighs before  blackens his nose with a square punch. stewarts  is tragic. ambition plays a role but his character is initially more weak than strong to his much younger wifes ambition and manipulative sensuality. lady  resides in this play as a two dimensional character and fleetwood embodies it brilliantly although she teeters on giving a little too much dimension to her role. it is stewart who is here to change before our eyes. he transitions from worthy thane to a husband who fears failing his wife into a murderer and into madman and stewart is sure to project that as a man he is conscious of these declining transitions throughout. stewart wins the power struggle with fleetwood while in the kitchen just before the banquet scene when he literally gains the upper hand and leads fleetwood to the feast.  is also a man who in this production gives in to fate rather than to the sword of . when he speaks his final words in the midst of battle hold enough this  is winning on the battlefield but he stares fate in the face as the sisters three enter the scene in silence and  gives in with a sort of mad relief. sophie hunter polly frame and niamh mcgrady play the three witches and they are most frightening because they are presented in alternate roles that ought to be anything but threatening. they are the nurses who tend to the dying soldier in the first scene. they work in the cook the thief his wife and her lover style kitchen sweeping with large brooms and chopping with even larger butcher knives. they serve in the banquet scene but the audience knows they are the always looming presence of fate mixed with evil. after martin turner who delivers an impeccably skeptical and edgy  is murdered on a train rather than on some road to safety and after a fluid and eerie scene transition from train car to banquet table goold offers his audience two versions of s ghost. the first terrifies the hell out of us as we see what  sees. the second offers an alternate perspective on the same scene as well as subtle differences that lead the audience to question their own minds right along with . although stewart does a fine job seeing a ghost who is not there its the witches who make the second rendition of the banquet scene so terrifying with some now you see them now you dont knives behind their backs and with looks on their faces that give the impression that all this has happened before perhaps at the beginning of time when they weaved s fate. scott handy plays a young and green  who does not seem ready to become a king especially when he attempts to test s loyalty to scotland by seeming the tyrant versus the just ruler. handy delivers his lines in such a way that lets the audience know he is making the whole thing up but only because  not handy is a poor actor and cant believably deliver himself as a tyrant or as an unjust man all this taking place in a piano bar for some reason. its  however who turns the tables and teaches malcomb what it means to be a man as well as the importance of feeling. michael feast as  delivers the most emotional scene of the play when he stops all action one hand holding onto the chair seated to his left. he lets out two breaths that seem to be his last in life and he feels the death of his family of all his pretty chickens as a man. and their deaths are gruesome staged as a chaotic nightmare with just a flash of the horror that takes place. also memorable is the porter. christopher patrick nolan plays the porter as well as s attendant . both characters are memorable and both are just plain evil. stewart beckons  three times pronouncing the name as satan to come and deliver news and ready his armor.  embodies the same silent evil presence as the witches and it makes his as frightening as hellfire. it also makes him an interesting character as this so called satan is here at the fall of the play serving . the porter serves up his own bit of evil literally urinating in the sink right before our eyes and masturbating in front of lady  and her young children. he wont be forgotten anytime soon. nor will many of the images goold offers his audience. this production is dark and bloody and it is both in your face and occasionally beautifully subtle. goold mentions in one of his many interviews that you may not feel the decadence of tragedy at every show. there might be that coughing in the audience that breaks it or that cell phone that rings. there was something in the theatre on my night that broke it and it seems as though the cast knew it as they took their bows to an audience that somewhat flaccidly stood in ovation. this is contrary to other nights im told. much coughing my night and there was that odd woman next to me who several times nodded off and then complained about not being able to hear the actors on stage. perhaps she awoke during the sisters not quite in unison rap scene. if thats the case i would concur. hence the biggest tragedy on this particular night was that it was broken. perhaps it was fate. my fate that i can somehow see through and make my own projections that this production is something greater than ill ever know.,4,Tragedy,Positive
Macbeth,San Francisco Audiences Need to Catch Up to a Post-Modern Macbeth,Denise Battista,thomas hampson is a tough nut to crack. bass and fellow ohioan go buckeyes raymond aceto who plays  in directors david pountney and nicola raabs production of verdis  italian at the san  opera through december 2 goes on to say hampson holds court with whomever hes with. at the moment hampson was holding court with his party of four at the after performance hotspot jardinière located just round the corner from san s decadent war memorial opera house. my objective was to somehow politely intrude and score a moment with the devastatingly talented and handsome leading man. while i pondered the proper time to pounce i realized acetos playful warning not only applies to hampson but to this production as a whole. pountney and raabs production holds one hell of a court even if their audience doesnt always know how to return their serve. opening night did not exactly achieve the no less than twenty five bows of verdis opening in 1847. i heard the buzz about the boos directed at the members of the production team who dared to take a bow. no boos were heard during or after my november 18th matinee. in fact another thomas san  symphony maestro mtt who was seated to my right offered a hearty bravo following hampsons dramatic heart wrenching and perfectly pitched aria at the end of act 4. take that to the bank. but then hampsons delivery both vocal and dramatic is not at all in question here the baritone reigns constant and supreme throughout. the question weighs heavily on the shoulders of set designer stefanos lazaridis and costume designer marie jeanne lecca who attempt the avant garde with an audience that seems to be stuck in the pre defined the conventional and the mainstream when it comes to opera. this isnt your sit back and enjoy the show through your opera glasses kind of opera but a little work never hurt any brain now did it? aside from some talented singers and aside from an orchestra conducted by massimo zanetti that accompanies at times amazes and unfortunately attends to outdoing alfredo portillas tenor rendition of  the audience is hit left and right with thought provoking spectacle. it seems as though s castle is synonymous with a carnival funhouse while  is a visitor turn permanent resident in the end. ive yet to account for the bizarre crater like hole ripped through the ceiling of this dark stage i conjure hell on earth without reference but the main prop that moves from stage right to left turns backward to forward is a large wooden box that serves as  and his ladys home. within are distorted mirrors right and sinister and its lit with painfully bright white florescent lights. consider living in this distorted glass house being forced to look upon your reflection in the beaming white light at all times and then throw in a regicide and the murder of your best friend. home sweet home. hungarian born soprano georgina lukács is the perfect vocal fit for lady  so if youre expecting a sweet and melodious soprano think again. lady  is in the words of hampson the embodiment of evil and thus lukács voice is sometimes screeching sometimes soft sometimes frightening sometimes beautiful at times seductive other times guttural and always powerful. we do not love lady  but we are affected. lukács is introduced as a sideshow barely visible as she sleeps atop the wooden box during act 1 scene 1. upon awakening we see she has a thick black rope connecting her waist to the box. the witches watch her show from below relaxing in a makeshift lounge as lukács speaks her opening lines while pacing back and forth then up and down on all fours like an animal. verdi himself directed that certain parts of lady  must not be sung at all but must be acted declaimed in a voice that is hollow and veiled. without this the whole effect is lost. this hollow and veiled effect comes to dramatic life during the sleepwalking scene. lukács battles with the damned spot while inside the florescent box snuffing her own candle twice between scribbling on the glass doors in madness. the doors are closed toward the audience to reveal her musings and lukács continues to sing from inside. the auricular effect hollow and veiled. the dramatic effect frighteningly breathtaking. vocally lukács and hampson are dynamic dramatically not so much with the obvious critique falling on lukács rigid and sometimes robotic movements. its as though lukács cannot produce a powerful note at the same time as an easy gesture. in effect the necessary erotic tone between the two is lost. with a bravo to lighting designer jürgen hoffmann this stage is made up of two kinds of light natural and manmade with a  of brilliance between the two. the image of sunlight enters with hampson stage right as he returns home after hearing or reading the first prophesies from the weird sisters. oh never shall sun that morrow see. we dont see this natural light enter the stage again until  is nightmarishly slain and malcom is crowned. all other lighting is painful or deceiving in some way. bright white florescent lights rule the distorted funhouse a glowing green light turns the dry soil downstage left into turf and back into soil again and again projections of the libretto seem to jump out of the walls like a sort of psychedelic torture chambering the second set of prophesies. and then theres that typewriter placed center stage at times glowing green with a small tree birnam you know planted gently to its right. what of that? i like to think its a snub to the likes of me the critic the journalist the writer of opinion and at times the creator of fate. the power of the press is frightening. and so are the weird sisters who are accompanied by a symphonic sideshow chorus of thirty tawdry witches clad in red performing a bevy of acts from hula hooping dumbbell lifting ipod grooving nail painting typewriting to the acid trip puppeteering of the sleep deprived . verdi envisioned the witches to be rude and gossipy exalted and prophetic and fully a part of the human condition. pountney and raab responded by making their witches prevalent throughout their production and the sisters mummified journalists wrapped in scraps of newsprint from head to toe. they are decrepit yet somehow preserved. during their first set of prophesies the mute and crooked creatures slowly circle the stage tearing pieces of print from their bodies and forcing them upon hampson who responds with an immaculate duet with aceto who attempts to defy fate by tearing the words. the scene ends with hampson walking toward aceto raising his arm and placing his hand upon acetos shoulder while singing in italian i must not raise my hand against fate. this production is both blatant and inconspicuous. we dont see a floating dagger  does. s blood is not red but drips from lady s hands as a clear green slime only to underscore the disgusting and unnatural act of regicide. s ghost does not attend the banquet rather three long tables aligned stage left to right reveal a feast of dirt and a shocking grave like emergence of the weird sisters always looming always present rising from the dead earth that is said to have created man. and what of man? i had several minutes and a glass of good wine to contemplate before pouncing on hampson and his captivated party of four. after recovering from a momentary episode of weak knees and thick tongue i asked hampson why it is after all that occurs why it is we still love . hampson corrected my use of love by saying that to do so would be naïve. i concur and i believe i was confusing the character with current company and some other lusty concept but i digress  hampson eloquently describes  as having compromised morality and as the everyman with whom we can identify. his decisions are conscious he battles with himself and with the concept of morality. there are consequences to his actions and lessons to be learned both blatant and not. this onstage box that seems to be creating quite an upheaval with my fellow journalists helps to exemplify this concept of the everyman. in act 4 scene 1 the glass doors are closed and the unlit box faces the audience. as the chorus of scottish exiles laments the tyranny of the state the audience is able to see their own reflection in the glass doors. in effect we become everyman and i for one dont have a stone to throw.,4,Tragedy,Positive
Macbeth,The Store-front Scottish Curse,Matthew Kellen Burgos,there is a stereotype that runs rampant throughout the los angeles theatrical community. theidea that most productions are merely actor showcases under the guiseof dramatic entertainment is almost an assumption an assumption thatmust be broken by a consistent design and performance. in some ways it becomes an elevated challenge to produce solid theatre due to this powerful pre conceived notion. declan s theatres production of  does little to change this persistent identity of los angeles store front theatre. locatedat the noho actors studio in north hollywood the space seems as much aclassroom for scene work as home for s words. walkinginto the theatre itself presents the audience with an exceptionallywide proscenium space that appears flat and unfortunately it isntthe only element of the production that lacks depth. jeff morris conception of  centers on the basic themes of greed and ego in a contemporary american political system. dueto the inherent parallels between the text and the current eventssurrounding our administration the idea is certainly not very original. there have been numerous productions around just the los angeles area that have made very similar choices. yet the execution is the main enemy of this productions success. theactors wear modern suits there is an american flag flying in thebackground there are sound effects of helicopters trolling overheadand the instruments of murder are guns and knives. sadly these are the only substantial elements that have been added to the unchanged dialogue. as a result the updating of the classic tragedy feels woefully forced and without any true inspiration. the extremely low budget set design by brian reindal appears virtually unnecessary. there are occasional chairs and tables that move between scenes. the black walls have chalk echoes of red white and blue. there is a fairly elaborate chalk mural of state buildings on the back wall and a single american flag that hangs from one of the walls unceremoniously. however none of these elements add dimension to the actors performances. each element feels haphazard and none are aesthetically pleasing. acompletely blank stage would have been less distracting and theambiguity may have allowed the audience to create more parallels forthemselves. matthew buenaluz is unable to do anything with the limited lightingsystem to aid in bringing depth to the monochromatic set design. armed with only a few instruments buenalez uses no color or angle to pop the actors out from the background. to make matters worse there are dead spots in which the performers are in shadows which does nothing for dramatic effect. the costumes suffer from a similar malady. many of the suits fit poorly which truly lessens the image of untouchable government figureheads. lady wears outfits that are vaguely reminiscent of jackie o whichdont ever quit fit in with the rest of the male and female politicians. there was no individual costume designer and it shows in the inconsistent look of the production.  overallthe production design isnt abrasive it simply presents the time andplace without any artistic flair or attention to realistic detail. as with most  productions the words can often make up for the lack of impressive production value. however to reap this reward the performers must allow the words to drive their emotion physicality and tempo. in this case the performers seem to fight the inherent rhythms in the language at every turn. jeff holden plays a stiff and predictable  and ultimatelymost of the performers suffer from a stiffness that plays in directopposition to the passionate behavior present throughout the story. holdenseems like a competent performer and never has completely unbelievablemoments but there is very little to see in the way of post traumaticstress of a warrior now walking amongst politicians. lady played by wallis herst is often meek and shows fewdiscernable tactics in her efforts to guide  towards hisinevitable end. the relationship lacks sexual energy and tension and herst does very little to emasculate her paranoid husband. the rest of the cast performs in a variety of styles which makes the overall tempo erratic and jerky.  jennings plays a simple kind  with an almost soap opera quality. patrick blakely is over the top as seatonthe porter and belongs in a musical or farcical comedy. megan morrison is subtle yet unbelievable as elady young . overall the performances are disconnected and without a tone of ensemble. los angeles theatre is costly and extraordinarily difficult to produce in a complete manner. good ideas and competent performers tend to lose the battle to rehearsal time traffic and budget. however can often stand by itself with a cast and crew that put faithin the words rather than a grand social statement. as an audience member it is truly a shame when the text is lost amongst political themes and ideology. thevisceral emotions held within the scottish play arent allowed toplay in declan s theatres store front production and the resultis a long evening in north hollywood.,1,Tragedy,Negative
Macbeth,Witch's View,Matthew Barbot,normally opening on a dark and stormy night would be considered a bad omen for a theater production but it may prove to be a good thing when the play youre performing begins when shall we three meet again? in thunder lightning or in rain? besides any company thats decided to put up a production of  either isnt superstitious enough to believe in bad omens or is laughing in the face of bad luck anyway. such was the situation on last nights opening of piper theater productions .  a downpour forced the show out of park slope brooklyns j.j. byrne park and into the auditorium of the middle school across the street. its hard to say whether the show suffered from the transition but i can say i plan to see it again to find out. while it starts off rocky this production is full of some marvelous moments owing mostly to  p. mcenenys direction and breathtaking visuals.in this production the supernatural takes a front seat. the witches are on stage for much of the play and seem very invested in s success even going so far as to provide the scotsman with everything he needs. in a beautiful dance like sequence the witches and a retinue of spirits taunt  with ethereal daggers before finally giving him a pair. when he needs to do away with  and his son  the witches provide him with a group of ethereal faceless murderers reminiscent of the black riders from the lord of the rings films who move and speak as one. but theyre not just in it to aid . to the contrary the entire situation seems to fill them with childlike glee and they are sure to interact with every player in their prophecy as if it is they and not fate that are responsible for its completion. every time a character is killed the witches lead the soul of the departed offstage presumably into their cauldron which is not a real cauldron at all but rather a writhing mass of tortured spirits. sometimes they choose to have a little fun first however. it is the witches who lead s ghost into s castle leading to one of the best banquet scenes i have ever seen. when  receives the news of his familys murder the witches lead their spirits around him in a parade agonizing  and forcing him to declare revenge. each time the witches are onstage mceneny delivers an impressive powerful take on familiar scenes each visually arresting sequence left me with goosebumps.of course the production isnt exactly perfect. while the acting becomes rather good with a few standout performances such as thomas pipers lead and sean phillips outstanding  after  makes his or in the case of this production her fateful entrance into dunsinane the beginning is rocky. the actors tend to play their characters as they will be not as they are in that moment in the play which robs them of the dynamism they are afforded in the script. this is particularly true of the lead role none of s initial confusion and awe of the witchs prophecies or his reluctance to go through with regicide come across. further while the music is very successful where it works it more often seems inappropriate. the play may also suffer from an overabundance of fight scenes. does lady  really need to grab a sword and put up a fight when the murderers show up?piper productions  is overall a very good production. it is well acted and well costumed and very very well staged the witch sequences alone make this production worth seeing. and hey what better way to spend an evening than a free  performance outdoors?,4,Tragedy,Positive
Macbeth,Not Your King James' Macbeth,Tue Sorensen,to beguile the time look like the time as lady  tells her husband. director conall morrison takes her words for a thousand pound as he reverses the originally perceived heroism of s prowess in battle into the core conflict of the play. in this production the problem that gives rise to all the mystery witchcraft ambition greed and disaster of this play is the horror of war. the performance opens with a pitched battle.  kills everything around him men women and children alike. he leaves the battlefield with no one breathing. but then three women awake from the dead see their children slain and resolve to revenge themselves on  in order to put their childrens souls to rest. they are the three witches. all that happens is controlled by the witches. the actresses sarah malin mojisola adebayo and frances ashman double as most of the servants bringing messages to . their hand is in everything that transpires. besides supernatural creatures the witches also clearly represent s conscience tormenting and destroying him. it is a brilliant interpretation of the play even if the witches have largely taken over lady s role as the basic propulsion of s ambition and destruction. there is one scene that i regard as redundant and unnecessary. at one point the witches put  in a noose and rape him. this scene does nothing except beat us over the head with the ongoing symbolism. perhaps it is included due to a directorial perception that modern audiences appreciate a certain rawness but this is a scene that this reviewer could well have done without. another disturbingly raw scene occurs when s third child yet unborn is cut from lady s belly. i can accept this scene only because  subsequently and repeatedly asks about all his children and all usually means more than two so it does make sense that there would be a third. despite these few slightly over the top instances this production is a sheer and amazing pleasure to watch. the actors speak clearly and powerfully with particular note to patrick okanes scottish accent coming through as absolute audio bliss. nor could i find fault with the acting which is all round worthy of what we have come to expect from the royal  company even with half the cast including okane being rsc debutantes. as one might expect okane is especially capable in the title role supplying a performance that highlights every one of the classic features of his character from dangerousness and strength to doubt and confusion. and how chillingly he does scowl the set and costumes are fairly spartan without being simple and work ideally for this small and dark stage where they both contribute to without detracting from the brooding mood. this is my first experience with a live rsc production and i am as impressed with it as i could possibly wish to be. in direction and acting alike it is executed by people who truly know what they are doing making this play come alive with an intellectual and theatrical energy that i have never before associated with . in short it is the best  i have seen.,5,Tragedy,Positive
Macbeth,Witches Rule in Macbeth's Court,Denise Battista,the scottish play has always been viewed as fast and furious with some thought that scenes may have been lost along the way.  character development is at a minimum yet we still find ourselves connecting to and relating with  and his fatal decisions.  its difficult to determine whether  is the victim of fate or the master of his own universe so much so that both possibilities must be considered when judging this character.  perhaps this is how we judge our own missteps in life.  perhaps this is why we can connect with  as a tragic hero rather than a villain.it seems as though director jeremy cole considers both fate and choice in his fast paced production of  by way of the weird sisters.  the witches played by martha stookey carrie smith and molly holcomb are s representation of the past present and future not necessarily in that order.  they are destiny they are the fates. on this stage the witches are not only omnipotent and omniscient they are also omnipresent onstage even when off.  this omnipresence leads one to question whether the sisters are truly omniscient or if they are just calling it like they see it and providing  with choices.  what do i mean by this?  the weird sisters do their usual cackle brew and conjure and well at that but they also take on other roles without completely stepping out of their original witchy characters.  for instance the play begins the witches meet fair is foul and foul is fair and with a wave of her red cape witch becomes bleeding captain telling of s heroic exploits on the battlefield.  no costume change no scene change just a turn and a flow into character.  more vividly stookey plays the head witch and takes on the role of the scottish thane .  stookey delivers her lines as  with all the look and intonation of her omniscient doppelganger leaving the audience to question who is whom and who knows what. my only problem with this tactic is that it can be confusing for someone who is relatively unfamiliar with the play. i can imagine that some of my audience members were trying to figure out why one of the witches was hanging out at court but it is also the most brilliant part of coles production and luckily it weaves in and out of the play from beginning to end.creative costuming is somewhat lacking with the subterranean players. these actors visually fulfill the waiter actor stereotype in their black and white polyester vested attire with golden bands around the heads of royalty. its forgivable costumes are expensive and as a  purist i need and get not an expensive and ornate set to enjoy . what i do need are good ideas that are well executed. i like cole. i like that he sometimes beats his audience over the head with a concept hearken back to his 2006 production of richard iii and the always present and echoing queen margaret. i also like his mirroring synchronicities such a our seductive lady  stephanie demott who upstage embraces her husband from behind while manipulating his ear to act and kill and later downstage stookey embraces  paul jennings in the same fashion.jennings and demott work well together and their chemistry is apparent but jennings alone is a bit stiff in his interpretation and delivery making connection with this  difficult. this is unfortunate considering this connection is necessary if we are to empathize with  and see him as human. demott however is engaging and her growing distraction mesmerizing. i do believe i actually saw the invisible blood on our ladys hands as she tried in vain to rub it out. i hardly even noticed the kicked over candle or the blown lights above as she wiped and rubbed her hands.thanks to jack of all trades halton for scooping up the candle and saving us all. tried and true an jack halton wears many hats in this production. the kindly yet ill fated  a drunken porter crawling across the stage with a hunk of cheese this is a porter i wont soon forget a priest in ? a murderer and the doctor. i do hope halton was well paid for his revolving door of characters.lynn  tijerina who plays both  and lady  is a welcome presence on the stage. her delivery and timing are impeccable throughout. i was unimpressed by ben grubb as  until i was pleasantly surprised and deeply touched by his reaction to the murder of his wife and children. all his pretty chickens and their dam. his heartfelt monologue his knees hitting the stage and barbers adagio coming from above creates something beautiful and bittersweet.opening night flubs occur. broken lights and falling candles a stuttered line here and there. i was shocked to hear artistic director geoffrey pond call the play by its name within the theatre. tis the scottish play man forgive my superstitions and on opening night you need all the luck you can muster. this production has its share of weak actors mostly in lesser roles but if i can play fate for a moment here loosen jennings tie hire an electrician to make sure every scene is enlightened and not lost and perhaps conjure a little luck i believe coles good production can only get better.,3,Tragedy,Negative
Midsummer Night's Dream,Revival Tours Chesco with a Late Summer Night’s Dream,Jennifer Kramer,revival productions was founded in 2017 to help revitalize the arts in coatesville pa. this summer they have set their sights on bringing quality theater to all of chester county with one of the most archetypal  in the park productions a midsummer nights dream as a touring outdoor production the set design is by necessity minimal with no permanent structures and only a handful of props. however the amphitheater at anson b. nixon park in kennett square proves to be an excellent setting. a colonnaded overlook of the pond by the kennett square reservoir substitutes for a backdrop highlighting the plays arboreal setting and adding textural interest with the cries of waterbirds or the occasional bat sweeping through to feast on the stage lights insectile audience. amy lentzs costume design is eminently fitted to the productions sylvan characteristics with a simple fantasy aesthetic drawing on natural elements and reminiscent of another local source of entertainment the pennsylvania renaissance faire. lentz keeps to a natural palette of greens and neutrals but indulges in some minor color coordination for the four lovers  and  in complementary shades of forest green  and  in soft browns. the actors most of whom are double cast start with a base uniform of green face paint and flowing peasant shirts with simple breeches leggings or handkerchief hemlines. over this they layer basic accessories to designate the different groups of characters.  and  wear crowns and capes the athenian women bear flower crowns and the men wooden swords the rude mechanicals carry the simple instruments of their trade or in bottoms case a set of devil sticks all the fairies wear floral headdresses though only s court has graceful white fairy wings. the acting style throughout the production is rather broad which does not allow for very much nuance. however the casts energy and enthusiasm makes it clear this is a deliberate choice and largely succeeds in translating the plays humor. donavan mcdonald gives  a cartoonish exuberance complete with funny voices and slapstick antics. sami waters  emily rader  austin james  and  lentz  bring a very youthful vibe to the four lovers complete with  and  competing for s love with schoolyard contests of foot races and rock paper scissors as  and  reminisce about their childhood while playing concentration or skipping around the stage. many productions double cast the same actor as  and  and wesley don hopkins ably plays both rulers in the tyrants vein.  first chuckles derisively at s desire to follow her heart then explodes in anger that she would dare defy her father. s temper is no less hot his scorn for  no less keen and hopkins adds a helping of fairy insouciance with the way he lounges on stage or occasionally on his fairy servants. however when  is faced with s grotesque infatuation and  with the unconscious lovers sleeping in the woods or possibly just with s and  snuggling end to their enmity the monarchs shift to mercy and a desire for cooperation. like the contrast of bottoms preferred and actual role hopkins shows the tyrant becoming the lover. director ajene livingston counterbalances the productions simple set up and straightforward acting with several higher concept elements with varying results. the soundtrack by composer and sound tech marshall lentz is a definite highlight an instrumental accompaniment that shifts between regal fanfares and otherworldly beauty. the only exception is the hilariously unhip hip hop backing to pyramus and thisbe which has all the street cred of a cool 90s fast food training video livingstons choice to compound the awkwardness of the rude mechanicals with the variable talent of white people rapping is an inspired one. less successful are livingstons attempts to more fully include the audience in the production. the first scene plays on the concept of a theatrical versus a royal audience and has  and the young lovers addressing the house as if they are  however with  clearly sitting upstage center this only serves to provoke disbelief that he would put up with constantly talking to peoples backs. throughout the play actors frequently make improvised asides to the audience but due to issues with the sound systems balancing this serves only to obscure both aside and dialogue. the production does conclude on a stronger note however when the spectators are invited to join in the final dance and the fairies benediction. despite the occasional shortcoming revival productions a midsummer nights dream is a spirited first attempt filled with creativity and vitality. chester county can look forward to a future filled with equally lovely ways to spend a summers night.,4,Comedy,Positive
Midsummer Night's Dream,Delaware Midsummer at Rodney Square,Jennifer Kramer,the pandemic may have imposed limits on many companies preferred types of productions but delaware  has not let it interfere with their mission to make  accessible to the community. for their first full length production in two years they have staged their free and family friendly version of a midsummer nights dream in rodney square in the heart of downtown wilmington. few productions can say their set was constructed by the same millionaire philanthropist as the empire state building   rodney square was created in the early twentieth century by  j. raskob. the sprawling marble steps are not the most obvious choice for the natural environs of midsummer but the company successfully adapts to the location nevertheless. the initial scenes in athens take place on largely unaltered marble however once the action moves into the woods nets of leaves camouflage the sides of the monument and fairy lights fittingly highlight the outlines of trees. the moon being represented by a lantern hung on a stick is the crowning touch an extremely funny metatextual reference to the rude mechanicals own lunar attempt in pyramus and thisbe. the cast makes good use of the space ranging up and down the steps and adding a scope that resonates with the plays themes of wildness and independence. costume designer ilycia buffaloe adopts a similar blend of the ordinary with the extraordinary. the production is lightly coordinated modern dress with the color palette largely focused on reds and blues or their pastel equivalents the style is fashion forward a few multicultural touches. while the athenian characters appear relatively restrained the fairies augment their outfits with led lighting and brilliant glowing paint   a detail that links them directly to the similarly luminescent staging and the productions magical special effects. broad acting styles are a popular choice for outdoor productions and they are expertly deployed here. the cast is excellent at portraying larger than life personalities without letting them slip too far into caricature. tanaquil márquez as bottom delivers all of the characters grandiosity with an almost sweet enthusiasm centering bottom as the core of the rude mechanicals social and artistic endeavors. márquez amplifies the humor of the characters existing shenanigans by these unlikely brushes with leadership as when bottom spontaneously decides that pyramus and thisbe should be a bilingual production flute frank jimenez happily follows suit and not a single other participant sees anything wrong with suddenly switching to spanish mid show. the four lovers offer another fun group dynamic with each character having complementary quirks. adaeze nwokos  is truly fierce her maidenly modesty a misty covering over a towering rage she gives  a very intimidating physical demeanor which is more than capable of delivering on its promise. as a counterpoint frank jimenezs  is playful and exuberant bellowing confessions of love even before falling under the influence of fairy juice. david pica and natajia sconiers meanwhile flip the standard dynamics of  and s relationship on its head. sconiers makes it clear that s determination gives her the increasingly entertaining confidence to pursue  with whatever wild declarations fall out of her mouth. in contrast picas  is quite timid unable to make  cease her pursuit or stand against s rejection though the vicious purple nurple she deploys against him couldnt have helped either. love in idleness gives him confidence to hilarious extremes but pica makes the intriguing choice to keep a tempered version of that confidence even after the lovers leave the forest in this production the love spell has not just attached him to a more appropriate partner but has left him with other tangible benefits as well. director bi jean ngo strikes an excellent balance in overcoming the challenges of outdoor productions adding enough spectacle to keep the action from being overwhelmed by the surroundings without overshadowing the original play. the magical effects are relatively straightforward   the lights decorating the rodney memorial are turned on and off while soundscape designer jonathan whitney provides rattles and chimes   but they are expertly timed and choreographed with the cast. whitney also provides the percussive accompaniment which adds an unusual but compelling soundtrack to both the action and the dance breaks. the chorus contributes to a few numbers as well though they seem a little disappointingly underused. michael hahns sound design is top notch and the sound system is clear and reliable something which a summer of outdoor productions has shown to be an impressive feat. ngo wisely keeps up a cracking pace which prevents the over the top acting from ever outstaying its welcome. the text is extensively edited to support the brisk action however which does introduce some imbalance. the storyline of the lovers gets the primary focus sometimes at the expense of the rude mechanicals or the fairies   a problem only because both are equally fun to watch. a similar not quite issue is bottoms transformation into a donkey. between márquez charming enthusiasm the cute and colorful patchwork pattern of the ass hat and reduced interactions with  or the other fairies there is nothing remotely monstrous or objectionable about his metamorphosis which makes eric mills remorse as  come out of nowhere. however the transformative editing also develops this in a satisfying way in cutting the lines where  steals the changeling ngo portrays his objections to s state as the result of a genuine change of heart not just a concession because hes gotten his way. this more gentle resolution fits well with the family friendly tone of the production another well calculated adaptation. delaware s a midsummer nights dream appeals to a broad audience without sacrificing the charms of s original. whatever their age or culture if they can make it to rodney square the community can see itself reflected back a living historical monument to the magic of love friendship and laughter.,5,Comedy,Positive
Midsummer Night's Dream,Genderqueer Shakespeare in the Park,Jennifer Kramer,while the most high profile examples of his work tend to concentrate on the cisgender and the heterosexual there has always been a focus on a much wider exploration of gender and sexuality in s oeuvre. over 80% of his sonnets including famous love poems like shall i compare thee to a summers day? are addressed to a fair youth. in his dramatic works all of his female roles were originally performed by men from the comic relief all the way to the romantic leads. several plays especially twelfth night and as you like it take this a step further by having their female characters adopt male personas in the process illuminating additional dimensions of gender and sexuality. however these explorations are largely portrayed as temporary or ambiguous perhaps to avoid disturbing social mores or running afoul of government censorship. the sonnets devolve into cryptic love triangles while the gender bending plays conclude with the characters conforming to their binary gender assigned at birth. in subsequent performance and study of s work cultural biases resulted in the suppression of most queer readings until the twentieth century. it is therefore a welcome change that stoneleigh a natural gardens production of a midsummer nights dream uses s text as a starting point to represent a wider scope of gender and sexuality. in 2016 stoneleigh was donated by the haas family to natural lands a non profit organization that saves open space cares for nature and connects people to the outdoors in eastern pennsylvania and southern new jersey according to media relations manager mae axelrod sheher. the 42 acre property combines its historic designs with native flora helping to restore something of the original local ecosystem and ease the strain of human development. midsummer is staged in the circle garden designed at the beginning of the twentieth century in the beaux arts style. the trees that line most of the bowl part at the southern end just as an embankment forms a step up to the encircling wall. this provides all the stage and set dressing needed for midsummer set as it is in the forest just outside a city. the thematic interest in contrasts is also continued by the costuming choices. the athenians appear in modern dress with a ed class divide in formality.  hehim wears a luxurious teal silk button down that matches s sheher statement necklace  sheher sports a lavender dress while  theyshe pairs a black lace shirt with a blue sash  hehim wears suit pants and a vest with his formal short sword and bracer. even s sheher casual outfit   athletic trainers denim shorts a matching vest and a black bikini top   is carefully coordinated. in contrast the rude mechanicals are almost aggressively informal.  hethey has a tie but his shirt is untucked from his shorts flute theythem appears to only own overalls though they do change into a charming floral pair in their starring role as thisbe bottom hehim wears a sports jersey   hes apparently 4 on the amusingly punny ballers   and bathing suit shorts. the fairies meanwhile have much more fantastical fashions that draw on several natural themes and largely eschew shirts.  and  both use the neopronoun love have golden crowns with the delicate outlines of branching trees in place of spikes and almost all the fairies wear cloaks of vibrant flowers designed by jacob glickman hehim. though their outfits are assembled from familiar garments the fairies sense of style is very much their own. while conceptions of gender may have been rather rigid in s time the use of pronouns was anything but. early modern english was rife with linguistic changes and speakers seemed fairly comfortable adopting neologisms and alternate forms.  was no stranger to singular they and used a as an all purpose pronoun for he she or it. his was frequently substituted for possessive s its had only begun to emerge in print in the 1590s much like  and there were no less than ten different options in the second person. as one might expect from a text produced in such an environment incorporating modern pronoun usage poses little challenge. director josh hitchens hehim helpfully provides both the actors and the characters pronouns in the program offering short explanations of nonbinary pronouns and neopronouns for those unfamiliar with the concept. all of these flow smoothly in the play itself even as the actors easily convey their characters gender identities. ryan walter hehim as  hehim sets the tone with a booming delivery that comfortably toes the line of bombastic walters  the neopronoun love also used by  suggesting a culturally specific gender is equally strident but with a distinct edge of anger. much of the cast adopts similarly broad performances which generally works well with the plays excesses they most excel at conveying energy and humor. quanece thompson sheher plays a cheerful and peppy  sheher a distinctive interpretation that livens the already lively dynamic of the four lovers. cj higgins theythem grounds the magic and musicality of the impish antics of  theythem with a down to earth attitude almost reminiscent of a workplace sitcom giving the impression that such shenanigans are all in a days work. as bottom hehim wyatt flynn theythem offers an exuberant performance as a rogue theater kid unleashed on the unsuspecting world. their comic timing is excellent whether its handling bottom becoming the butt of the joke after his transformation or delivering pyramus amazing death scene complete with impromptu musical number. though director josh hitchens incorporates modern themes and tweaks some of the plays action it is all based on a solid grasp of s original text. some minor changes deepen the plays subtext like gender swapping s character the unexplained opposition by  hehim to s suit now has the simple and unpleasant motive of homophobia behind it. similarly hitchens and stephanie stoner shethey craft a narrative through line for  with a few reactions one tweaked line and a handful of others reassigned.  storms off in disgust in the first scene when  upholds the legitimacy of making  choose between celibacy or death in iv.1 he then explicitly vows to change the law rather than simply overruling  as per  prompting his reconciliation with . in v.1 she then encourages him to select the rude mechanicals play and is given most of the lines praising their enthusiasm and good intentions. very little of s original text must be changed to paint a picture of a future ruler concerned with justice and the well being of even her minor subjects. however the pleasure of hitchens production does not solely rely on its thoughtfulness it is also incredibly funny and creative. bottoms translation into a literal butthead is a delightfully unexpected interpretation an asss head and flynn incorporates fart noises into their lines with precise aplomb. their musical contributions and cj higgins musical direction offer wonderfully on point covers like dancing cheek to cheek and dream a little dream of me as well as musical special effects for the magic and catchy original settings for s songs. the lullaby for  in ii.2 is a particular high point with  and flynns  getting carried away with headbanging to our fairy queer while the still awake  grows increasingly irate. the crackly sound system leaves something to be desired but for the most part there is little impediment to the ebullience of the production. stoneleighs first forays into the arts have been wildly successful connecting the audience to nature through their featured productions and they have similar hopes for midsummer. you dont need to stretch your imagination to believe in fairies when you are at a place as magical as stoneleigh states axelrod. meanwhile cj higgins in their capacity as the shows gender consultant notes our hope is that audiences can use this production as a jumping off point to learn more about the subjects of gender and pronouns and to show that anyone of any gender is worthy of respect protection and of course love. stoneleigh a natural gardens production of a midsummer nights dream should succeed on both counts using s foundation to fashion a showcase of the diversity of human experience in the beauty of nature.,4,Comedy,Positive
Midsummer Night's Dream,A Midsummer Night at PSF’s Midsummer Night,Jennifer Kramer,when blithely bandying about the aphorism life imitates art the general populace rarely shows any consideration for the audience members of outdoor productions of an theatre particularly those at a midsummer nights production of a midsummer nights dream. nothing quite highlights the urgency of s impassioned plea in act ii scene 1 for  to end their feud and its accompanying catastrophic weather like a lightning delay and the continual threat of a massive thunderstorm. one can only imagine the tragedy had this been a production of king lear. happily though the pennsylvania  festivals production of midsummer goes much smoother than any of the fairies plans the only electric charge is from the creative atmosphere and the only thing the audience is struck by is pure talent. in deference to these unprecedented times pa  commissioned their new outdoor theatrical space the incredibly appropriately named air products open air theatre from psf mainstay and set designer steve teneyck. the multi level polygonal stage as well as its backdrop and flanking towers is constructed almost entirely of handsome unpainted wood   something of a deconstructed forest but one that puts the focus on the ensuing shenanigans with a pleasing simplicity. the set dressing similarly abides by less is more. a large roundel with a line drawing of the crescent moon is suspended stage right two ladders sit upstage like a rogue production of our town standing in for the forest undergrowth and providing spectator seating for the fairies to watch the mortal drama unfold. one ladder even comes equipped with its own popcorn. a gajics costume design is more explicit using modern dress to evoke specific resonances. the lovers begin the play with the indelible s of a prep school upbringing with  in a twin set  in a lacoste esque button down and blazer and  in formal shorts and boat shoes only  in her chambray jumpsuit seems to have escaped the pressure of upper class conformity a visual indicator of her strength of mind and personality. on the other end of the social spectrum are the rude mechanicals in a variety of blue collar work gear uniforms and coveralls apart from bottom with his mustache aloha shirt flared jeans and cowboy boots unless the professional dress of a weaver requires looking like every 70s action star rolled into one person. their costumes in pyramus and thisbe are actually quite good    in   cosplay is a very funny touch   but they cannot quite conceal the casts true colors or rather flutes work boots under his dress and bottoms boxers beneath pyramus leather pteruges. a more effective transformation is the double cast formalwear of  and . a cream colored gauze and satin jumpsuit is augmented on  with a shrug and enormous sunglasses and on  with a massive 50 foot train the black suit on  loses its jacket sash and shirt in favor of s own more modest train a sarong like olive green satin number reminiscent of a ball gown. both fairy monarchs wear silver crowns in the shape of the crescent moon and their attendants wear distressed fencing whites emblazoned with a bright red heart over a mishmash of tulle skirts over pants over fishnet bodysuits. the production as a whole evokes another aphorism only steal from the best   in this case director matt pfeiffers own 2017 rendition of midsummer at the arden theatre. for the most part this is more an inspiration than a template but some elements have been imported directly   and fortunately prove just as entertaining a second time. the best transplant is the return of lindsay smiling as  and mary tuomanen as  whose comedy double act hilariously enlivens the already lively scenes of fairy mayhem. when hes not bickering with his bro smiling makes  and  alike charmingly sympathetic with both genuinely trying to help the young lovers while pining for the affection of eleanor handleys  and . handley meanwhile perfectly projects a facade of prickly propriety and lets it thaw just enough when  and  realize their partners earnest intentions. this hidden warmth permeates the performances of much of the cast. akeem davis gives  a lingering tenderness for brett ashley robinsons  that partly tempers his cruel words and suggests that ending the play under the spell of love in idleness isnt exactly an unwelcome fate. robinson meanwhile portrays a  whose strength is in her bold often loud authenticity channeling her emotions through alanis morissette breakup songs sexy spaniel impersonations or defiance of mockery. all of the casts comedic talents are considerable and some of their best work is as an ensemble. nowhere is this more evident than in the rude mechanicals magnum opus pyramus and thisbe where each character adds their own personalized bit of chaos to the growing maelstrom. one of the funniest gags is when bottom ian merrill peakes loses his prop sword and stabs himself with his finger which is then taken to eye popping extremes when flute eli lynn gleefully adopts the same method of stage death. pfeiffer manages the impressive task of trimming down midsummer to a tight 90 minutes without either sacrificing the text or rushing the pacing. if there is one element that suffers in comon to pfeiffers 2017 production and his oeuvre in general its the music. this is through no fault of composer alex bechtel who has produced another catchy and engaging score. when the production begins with  incorporating an impassioned plea to turn off cell phones into a company wide chorus along with the rest of the typical introductory spiel one cannot help but regret that this creativity is not featured more widely all of s songs have been cut and most of the music is relegated to the background. however this all may just serve to leave the audience wanting more and the charms offered by the pennsylvania  festivals a midsummer nights dream are more than capable of standing on their own. the audience may have one eye on the sky during this funny and engaging production but they are assuredly wiping away its tears of laughter. correction the role of flute was played by eli lynn not katie mcglone as was originally published.,5,Comedy,Positive
Midsummer Night's Dream,Apocalyptic Midsummer is no Run-of-the-Mill Production,Ginny Quaney,one of the difficulties of staging  is finding a new and unique way to present centuries old plays. as s most often produced play a midsummer nights dream is particularly challenging. but if the arvada centers black box repertory theatre company proves anything its that there is always a new and unique way to perform . in her directors note emily van fleet explains that this production of midsummer takes place in a sort of post apocalyptic hellscape where a band of players signified by a banner across the stage at the beginning of the show travel around performing s midsummer. their props and meager costumes are all contained in a grocery cart their stage is an old abandoned playground. but what van fleet doesnt mention in her directors note are two other significant shifts from a run of the mill production of midsummer   the cast of only eight actors and the swap of  and s roles. thats a lot to unpack and if the show has any flaws its that theres too much going on. the post apocalyptic theatre troupe conceit is so subtle in the beginning as to be unnoticeable or misinterpreted such that the ending where the actors pack up their props and costumes and leave their temporary stage to a beautiful madrigal sung in many part harmony by the cast feels a bit unearned and out of place. the  switch is uncommented upon anywhere and would only be apparent to an audience familiar with the text of the play which isnt necessarily fair to assume in this day and age. in fact even as familiar as i am with s canon i took longer than im proud of to realize why the fairies interactions felt different. this could be considered a good thing if the swap didnt convey a completely different   and phd thesis worthy unto itself   take on gender roles in the fairy world and by extension s and ours. as for the double casting the idea of having the same actors play  and   and  and the lovers fairies and mechanicals is another interesting one highlighting the parallels between the subplots particularly between the fairies and nobles of athens. but double casting works best if the actors have either no overlap played straight and subtle or a lot of overlap played up and to often hilarious extent in their various characters scenes. unfortunately van fleet chose a confusing middle ground leaving the audience to occasionally wonder wait is the actor playing  just doubling as   or is  now  ? rather nitpicky bits aside the cast and crew does a wonderful job with the interpretation. set designer brian mallgrave creates a beautiful abandoned playground complete with a jungle gymmonkey bars a merry go round or roundabout not to be confused with a full on carousel and a dumpster and every bit of the in the round stage is fully used. the merry go round is utilized as a bed for the lovers or a way for them to give chase or avoid each other. the jungle gym is used to creative effect as well a jungle gym by an energetic always moving  a bed for the sleeping unsuspecting  an escape route for the lovers from their admirers or adversaries in turn a balcony upon which  and  can watch and interfere with those foolish mortals. and the dumpster is a rather fun entrance and exit   it provides a hiding place for  to pop up whack a mole style an escape for  from her sudden rash of lovers and an extra height so that  her actress only a few scarce inches shorter than s can rightly be considered a small poppet. clare henkels costumes are similarly versatile. a sash and a crown change for  and  here an addition of wings to the lovers there and poof now were watching the king and queen of the fairies and their court argue over a changeling. a removal of fairy wings and now we are voyeurs to bottom   and company rehearsing their play for the duke. with the possible exception of bottoms too subtle colander with ears donkey head hat the costumes tell the audience exactly who were watching do what. as for the actors   all eight show off their range. the four loversfairiesmechanicals impressively span the spectrum from melodrama to outright comedy jessica austgen deserves a particular shoutout for her  who shifts from a poetic make love not war paramour of  madeline chilese to a 1950s tough guy greaser so obsessed with  anastasia davidson that he and  jake mendes literally come to blows on several occasions. the mechanicals performance is expectedly hilarious though davidsons portrayal of snout aka the wall so worried about how the lion the wall and the moon might be received is especially endearing. kate gleasons active and somewhat ruthless  whose intense desire for her husbands changeling boy is the root of all the plots misunderstandings fascinatingly counters her rather laid back almost passive . zachary s plays both  and  though differing in station and circumstance as exuding a fratboy with a heart of gold aura.  while somewhat obnoxious and overbearing is happy for the lovers and even seems to encourage rather than laugh at the mechanicals in their play  for his part is truly sweet in his temporary devotion to bottom and seems surprised and almost impressed when asking  for details of what occurred. and geoffrey kents bottom comes off as far more sympathetic than usual with his interruptions during the play discussions feeling less like a pompous actor than a too zealous friend trying to help his fellows performances and his fond remembrance of his dream relationship with  leaves the audience a little melancholy that he was the butt or bottom as it were of a fairys jealous joke. but its annie barbour as  who steals the show. many more traditional productions present  as mischievous mysterious and often malicious similar to the norse god loki. barbours  however is childlike in their mischief and mistakes rather like  pan the disney fied version not the darker barrie version. barbour flings herself across the jungle gym rides a tricycle and responds with half listening uh huhs and yeahs to s instructions and shows off s power by summoning a thunderstorm rendered by jon olsons lighting and jason ducats sound design while recalling the lovers to their respective couplings. and her version of s final monologue spoken to the audience upon a darkened spotlighted stage was poignant enough to bring me to tears. so while van fleets midsummer tried to be a few too many things each of those things was beautifully presented resulting in a lovely and unique production of s most popular play.,4,Comedy,Positive
Midsummer Night's Dream,Not Your Garden-Variety Midsummer Night's Dream,Benjamin Alper,it is hard to imagine a more fitting setting for a production of a midsummer nights dream than the atlanta botanical garden. with its beautiful lawns and exotic plants the garden is the perfect place to stage a play in which nature is such an important aspect almost a character unto itself. i was very excited when the alliance theatre announced it was performing its interpretation of dream at the garden this fall however while the alliances production was indeed beautifully staged and entertaining it unfortunately fell short of my hopes for what could have been such an amazing production. by far the best part of the production was the stage. the theater was built entirely for this production and was equally interesting and innovative. the stage was beautifully built to resemble several large lily pads on a pond. while more fun than your typical staging it provided the actors ample room to maneuver and helped bring the audience into the magical world of the play. the audience seating encircles the lily pad stage and enclosing the seating were white sheets topped with large leaves to resemble trees. while this type of environment made the performance more intimate it also had the unfortunate effect of robbing the production of any benefit of staging it at the botanical garden. the purpose of doing  outdoors is to allow the actors to interact with nature in an open air and expansive setting. unfortunately all of the excitement accompanying a magical dream experience in a garden was lost because this set could have been erected in any theater hall or school gymnasium with little difference in the experience. the acting however was delightful. given the garden setting the rude mechanicals were fittingly portrayed as gardeners moonlighting as actors tasked to perform a play as the weddings entertainment. the cast members did not shy away from making plenty of hilarious georgia specific references from confusing the plays original setting of athens in greece with the local athens home of the university of georgia bulldogs and the mechanicals prior roles as actors in the walking dead filmed in atlanta. the cast was small with only six actors performing all of the parts but each actor was excellent in their various roles. courtney patterson playing alternatively   petunia prune a.k.a.   and others is charming and plays well off of joe knezevichs bottom and . the other actors were similarly strong in their performances without a weak link in the cast. for the most part the costumes were relatively minimalist with the exception of bottoms donkey costume while somewhat over the top it delighted the children in the audience. this production is advertised as an adaptation of a midsummer nights dream and at only 90 minutes long it is most certainly that. however with so much of the original play cut out of this production and with so few cast members required to play so many different roles the plot was difficult to follow. thus while this production was entertaining it was difficult for the audience follow along if they didnt have a prior familiarity with the plot. and while the director probably assumed that most audience members were familiar likely having read it in high school it wouldnt surprise me if many left the production confused about the story line. in addition there were several musical interludes throughout the production which while enjoyable and entertaining didnt seem to fit with the overall plot of the play. dream is already one of s shortest plays and cutting so much from it really detracts from the overall enjoyment. as one of s most well known and popular plays any production of a midsummer nights dream will always attract audiences. combined with a setting as beautiful as the atlanta botancial garden the alliance theatre had the makings for a magical and memorable production of this play. normally when a performance is well staged well acted and entertaining its difficult to be disappointed but i left feeling that a wonderful opportunity to do something truly special had been squandered.,3,Comedy,Negative
Midsummer Night's Dream,Let Shakespeare Be Shakespeare in a Midsummer,Benjamin Alper,a midsummer nights dream is one of s most well known plays and is also the play that the general public is most likely to have seen even if they are not fans of  or the theater. because it is so well known most modern theater companies choose to put their own spin on their production either by changing the setting the timeframe or the perspective from which the play is told. while these different interpretations might be interesting and creative they can also distract from what is already an almost perfect comedy. thankfully the atlanta  companys recent production of a midsummer nights dream at the  tavern playhouse is smart enough to recognize that sometimes it is best for the theater company to simply get out of the way and let  be . of course it is easy to avoid fancy theatrical devices when you have such an amazing cast to fall back on. the atlanta  company has a great stable of talent and its fully utilized in this perfectly cast play. vinnie mascola undoubtedly steals the show as bottom. bottom is a comic actors dream role and mascola was born to play it. with his physicality and impeccable timing he is a force whenever he is on the stage. mary ruth ralston is also frightfully delightful as the mischievous . this production employs the common practice of casting the same actor to play both  and  and the same actor to play  and . while having the same actors play these important roles risks confusing the audience kenneth wigley and dani herd do such excellent jobs modifying their appearance tones of voice and mannerisms when switching from character to character that there is no confusion here. the actors playing the young lovers are also wonderful with kati grace browns feisty  being particularly enjoyable. the drama of a midsummer nights dream occurs not only in the world of the human characters but also in the fairy world as  and s domestic squabbles impact the humans around them. while  was technologically constrained from using changes in lighting and other special effects director j.tony brown utilizes them judiciously in this production to distinguish between the two interacting worlds in this play. pumping fog onto the stage and using red filtered lighting to highlight the fairies as they interact with the humans creates an intense and eerie feeling which highlights the tension and horror of what is otherwise a silly comedy. the most enjoyable part of a midsummer nights dream is the last scene when all the drama is resolved and the rude mechanicals get a chance to perform their play within the play. undoubtedly some directors might feel compelled to rush this final scene and treat it more as an afterthought since the intrigues of the main plot have already been resolved. but doing so is a grave mistake which robs this play of its funniest parts. rather than rush this scene brown drags this scene out and milks it for every last drop of humor. flanked on both sides by the athenian nobles the rude mechanicals with mascolas bottom as their leading man perform the now infamous the most lamentable comedy and most cruel death of pyramus and thisbe. seating the athenian audience on either side of the stage allows the mechanicals play to take up the center stage and puts the theater audience in the same position as the athenians. oftentimes it was hard to tell which audience was laughing harder as the actors playing the athenians seemed to genuinely find the mechanicals performance as hysterical as those of us that paid to see the play. since almost the entirety of this play takes place in a forest many productions spare no expense in creating elaborate and frequently beautiful set designs full of vibrant colors and lush verdant flora. while theres nothing necessarily wrong with these approaches to the set design they can distract from the action of the play. the atlanta  tavern with its minimalist set and inconspicuous costumes does not have that problem. in a time when directors are always trying to reinvent reimagine and reinterpret s works it is surprisingly refreshing to view a production that seeks to simply perform s play as it was written. this production proves that when you have talented actors it is often better just to let  be .,5,Comedy,Positive
Midsummer Night's Dream,The Ambiguity between Reality and Dream: The Great Lakes Theater production’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream,Yuko Kurahashi,it is a challenge for any director to stage a midsummer nights dream one of the most beloved works by . famous productions include  keans 1856 production with scenery of an imagined ancient city of athens with the pantheon herbert beerbohm trees 1900 production with illusionary scenery for the exteriorinterior of the palace and the woods and  brooks 1970 production with black and white floors and walls ladders and swings. the great lakes theater production of a midsummer nights dream directed by joseph hanreddy emphasizes the ambiguity between reality and dream creating scenery with contrasting opposing and yet related stage elements. to blur the two worlds scenic designer scott bradley used as his inspiration lori nixs photography of her installation the library which presents the interior of a deserted library with books trees and broken chairs. in this production the tall old and distorted bookcases situated on both sides of the stage suggest the futility of human lives while suggesting a repository of ancient wisdom and knowledge of magic. a three level main performing area plus a balcony upstage allow the performers to act across different levels of realities and dreams. two floor to ceiling bookcases four arch openings which repeat from center stage to upstage tree branches and flowers hung from a crochet mat evoke a mysterious mischievous dark and dangerous ambience that suggests both athens and the woods. at the beginning of the show in the heartless and dangerous human world the old patriarch  aled davies demands the execution of his daughter  michelle pauker who will not obey his order to marry  jon loya because she is already in love with  corey mach. however  is frivolous parading his charms and wits to conquer . thus rather than juxtaposing the rational athens and chaos the woods hanreddys human world is ironically equally chaotic to the extent that the magic applied by  m. a. taylor in the woods is caused by self indulgence and impulsiveness in the human world. after all  never wakes up from s magic spell at the end. the performers compliment this approach that hanreddy has taken. mach and loya as immature irresponsible  and  want to score their trophies. keri rené fullers  and paukers  though different in height are both physical impulsive and aggressive. paukers relentless physical attack against  and s defense and counter attack in the woods illuminate the battle between the two young women who are not affected by s magic spell but nonetheless incapable of grasping the situation.  nick steen and  jillian kates underscore the similarity between humans and fairies in animosity jealousy and prejudice. it is cruel that  watches his queen  have sex with nick bottom david  smith while it is equally unjust that  treats  as his property. while nick bottoms lust and infatuation with  and her equally strong infatuation for bottom are caused by s magic spell in this production the audience wonders if s self indulgence has led her to believe what she sees is someone extremely handsome and attractive not just an ass. the mechanicals serve as a respite from the chaos while bringing a new level of chaos due to their self absorption. in this production the performers who play the mechanicals also play the fairies establishing the symbiosis between humans and the spirits. costume designer rachel laritz has updated the costumes for the young lovers and the mechanicals.  wears a stark blue dress in the beginning and later in the woods she puts on white pants and a sleeveless shirt.  and  are dressed in the court scene in casual pants and jackets but their shirts are torn and muddy after they spend some time in the woods. s black attire and huge feathered headdress blur the distinction between  and . the mechanicals in this production are a building contractor   played by tom ford and his workers linking the world of  with a contemporary audience. lighting designer rick martin lights the downstage area brighter while dimming upstage to emphasize the magical dark and dangerous elements of both worlds. original music created by the sound designers rob milburn and michael bodeen evokes the mysterious enigmatic and foreboding ambiences while how sweet it is at the end suggests irony and sarcasm. great lakes theaters production of a midsummer nights dream is performed in repertory with the production of the hunchback of notre dame. the three actors who play the young lovers in a midsummer keri rené fuller corey mach and jon loya play respectively esmeralda quasimodo and phoebus de martin in the hunchback demonstrating their versatility as well as the chemistry of the ensemble.,5,Comedy,Positive
Midsummer Night's Dream,The Hedgerow’s Little But Fierce Midsummer,Jennifer Kramer,in production a midsummer nights dream is one of s more versatile plays suitable for everything from outdoor performances in the park to elaborate conceptual spectacles under the proscenium arch to big budget antics on the silver screen. the hedgerow theatre company and director aaron cromie take advantage of its flexible nature to show off their own versatility packing the plays wit humor and magic into an adaptation designed for just six actors. the production began its life on tour reflected in the relatively simple costumes and set. the play is performed in modern dress with each actor gaining or shedding layers to differentiate their triple  and quadruple cast roles. costume designer elizabeth hanson does a clever job packing a lot of detail into a few articles of clothing both allison bloechls  and madalyn st. s  essentially wear the same outfit a vest with their school crest black skirt and leggings and sneakers but s longer skirt and glasses signify a less conventionally attractive appearance to the shallow say . bloechls other roles illustrate hansons adaptability a long patchwork skirt and crocheted vest completes the groovy ensemble of hippie robin  while a flowing orange robe and flower crown transforms her into the fairy queen . the latter and its similar counterpart for  is slightly less successful as even the most seasoned actors would find it hard to pull off the otherworldly gravitas of the fairy characters in sensible shoes however s costume of a green hoodie and red gnome hat perfectly blends otherworldly aura with a modern aesthetic. the set constructed by shaun yates and zoran kovcic     creatively incorporates the hedgerows unique performance space. the doors and windows of the old mill whose façade backs the stage are blocked by encroaching vegetation meanwhile the stage is covered in mulch and a soundtrack of bird sounds completes the illusion of a historical structure being reclaimed by nature an excellent choice for midsummers dichotomy of civilization and wild space. there is one drawback to this arrangement as the blue gym floor mats necessary for the copious pratfalls arranged as a makeshift thrust stage at first appear very out of place. however though this seems incongruous with the setting it quickly proves a suitable complement for the shows humor the characters remain totally unaware of the small island of mats except whenever they try to enter stage right and trip right into a running gag. the cast is very strong and individually each role is funny and effective   all the more impressive given that every actor is responsible for no less than three separate parts throughout the show. allison bloechl gives  a sassy frustration and expertly delivers physical comedy but her hippie robin  is just as memorable with a recreational substance assisted easygoing attitude and an insistence on gender inclusive vocabulary. similarly josh porteras  is at first charming and then hilariously love sick fending off his equally infatuated rival   swift with an expertise in the slap based martial arts porteras snug the joiner meanwhile is enthusiastic but timid prone to stage fright and needs his big line roar written down immediately so he has enough time to commit it to memory. but even if these skillful performances were not a convincing enough display of their talents the casts joint work as  illustrates that they can also play each other susan wefel madalyn st.  bloechl portera and swift all take turns as that merry wanderer of the night each maintaining his humor and mischievous attitude. aaron cromies adaptation of midsummer would be notable just for the huge logistical accomplishment of successfully adapting it for six people characters are combined lines are reassigned and scenes are reordered but the plays basic themes and most memorable moments are never lost in the shuffle. however cromies work does not merely alter s play for necessity but draws out clever parallels and new sources of humor. traditionally doubled roles like  zoran kovcic and  bloechl make an appearance bringing up implicit parallels between those characters by extension having the low key blowhard  paired with high key blowhard bottom wefel or the four athenian lovers also doubled as the rude mechanicals raises questions about attempting to direct someones life as a parent or fairy in comon to being directed in an unintentionally hilarious farce. meanwhile the productions light hearted attitude takes gleeful advantage of the now metatheatrical nature of lines such as is all our company here? and what a play toward? ill be an auditor an actor too perhaps if i see cause. the result is a fun and energetic compact production by a talented cast and crew. hedgerow theatres production of a midsummer nights dream combines creativity enthusiasm and skill for a fresh take on a popular classic.,4,Comedy,Positive
Midsummer Night's Dream,Arden’s Midsummer Keeps You on Your (Tapping) Toes,Jennifer Kramer,as one of s most popular comedies staging a midsummer nights dream would seem to risk repetitiveness. however the sheer wealth of creativity in s mash up of ancient greece with british folklore covering everything from love to music to theater offers a nearly inexhaustible source of imaginative possibility. the arden theatres production of midsummer takes its cues from the plays own inventiveness but nevertheless has a few surprises in store. by far the strongest part of this already strong production is the acting made even more enjoyable by the productions highlighting of more unexpected characters. rachel camp channels all of s frustrated love into unshakeable self determination pursuing  with relentless ukulele serenades only to bravely ignore with great personal sacrifice both his public displays of affection and his shirtless abs while defending herself from his apparent mockery. dan hodge in a particularly amusing turn as bottom leads the rude mechanicals while their antics are punctuated by the sparing lines of robin starvling brandon j. pierce a skittish introvert never seen without his stuffed puppy who nevertheless delivers each mild observation or exclamation of fear in a hilariously dramatic basso rumble. lindsay smiling steals the show as  rejecting the standard interpretation of a stern deliverer of straight lines for a charmer more akin to the schlubby yet likable heroes of a judd apatow comedy. smiling frames s plot against  as a poorly repressed urge to win back her attention when  succeeds at claiming her ward as his page while she remains distracted smiling shows his lingering dissatisfaction and imbues the ending of her entanglement with bottom with disgust not triumph. this more warm hearted take on s love life supports smilings efforts to make s investment in the romantic travails of the athenian lovers seem genuinely sympathetic and even somewhat redemptive. katharine powell as  greets his matchmaking efforts with favor his impossible task achieved to win her back. another notable facet of smilings performance is the chemistry between him and mary tuomanens  truly a bromance of mythic proportions. tuomanen masters s energy with impeccable comic timing inspired tumbling and some powerful musical numbers   then adds to an already crackerjack performance the highly enjoyable push and pull dynamic of a seasoned comedy duo. their scenes unfold like a hilarious buddy comedy whether theyre lighting up a hookah while watching the theatrics of the athenians or   after a mishap with the love in idleness   recoiling in mutual horror at the possibility of falling in love with each other. paige hathaways scenic design has a usly ambiguous relationship to the rest of the production. the industrial grey bricks and steel girders of the backdrop balcony and overhang contrast nicely with the smooth wood of the thrust stage but no attempt is made to match the plays civilizationwilderness dichotomy with the blocking mortals and fairies both roam the whole stage at will. similarly the chairs and lampshades climbing askew up the walls may hint at the fairies caprice or the chaos of the plot upending the natural order or perhaps just an appreciation for modern art. however though the set is somewhat puzzling it is certainly eye catching and it provides a dynamic yet sturdy base for the energetic production. the vagaries of the setting are echoed by the costumes by designer a gajic. the production is modern dress and gajic successfully evokes character on the individual level s severe bob giant sunglasses and structured white jumpsuit and blazer give her a somewhat distancing class and sophistication s nantucket red shorts and boat shoes place him in the same social class as the similarly preppy  and  while s plaid shirt unshaven armpits engineer boots and asymmetric haircut give her a countercultural flair that reflects her feelings of exclusion from the group  dresses like the texan oil baron whose patriarchal mores he shares. the problem such as it is is that there is not much of a coherent theme throughout the production. while it makes sense individually for  to wear golden hammer pants and snake patterned bracers  to sport electric blue hair with striped leggings cargo shorts and some unfortunate drum majors jacket and  to stride confidently in a flowing yellow jumpsuit and matching fifty foot long cape as a group it is hard to draw conclusions about the fairies and their contrast to the mortals. nevertheless the set and costuming provide a solid backdrop to the actors performances and director matt pfeiffers clever storytelling. pfeiffer balances brisk pacing with latitude for comic timing banking on his actors expertise to for example navigate a full minute pause in the action as bottom waits for his helmet to stop rolling around on the stage so he can finish his monologue. pfeiffer employs a relatively light hand at textual editing though his splicing together of scenes 1 and 2 in act 3 is particularly effective and a thoughtful treatment of role doubling. the initial pre marital rockiness of  smiling and  powell flows smoothly into the conflict of  and  portrayed by the same actors s successful intervention for the four lovers is finalized by  blessing on their marriages which finds favor with  the happily married royal couple watch the rude mechanicals put on a show for their amusement much as the four lovers taysha marie canales as snout sean close as flute pierce as starvling and camp as snug entertained the fairies. in a final grace note pfeiffer teams up once more with original music and sound designer alex bechtel for a typically musical production. pfeiffers signature acoustic covers of rock artists like the kinks and eddie vedder are here mixed with the country flavor of bonnie raitt and don s and the casts instrumental and vocal performances give the production an indiefolk feel. meanwhile pfeiffer and bechtel employ the talents of eliana fabiyi musicianfairies for the rest of the productions original score using her violin and a loop pedal to create musical and technological magic. the result is a relentlessly engaging production. the arden theatre companys midsummer nights dream is both contemporary and elizabethan musical and comedic faithful and unpredictable the match of s creativity with considerable modern talent.,5,Comedy,Positive
Midsummer Night's Dream,A Festival Dream of Good and Evil,Claudine Nightingale,this production by action to the word was part of the theatre offerings at this years latitude festival in suffolk on the south east coast of england. the production is at an early stage in its development with a tweaked version of the production planned for the national theatre in london on 6 august. it wasnt overly apparent in this performance and yet they made good use of the festivals relaxed atmosphere to push the boundaries and experiment with the ideas and concepts they had chosen to explore through the production the result is a risqué and exciting couple of hours. latitude is a broad arts festival styled like a music festival but offering much more   an impressive music line up comedy literature and poetry tents a cabaret line up childrens and teenagers zones and a theatre arena. the festival site which is renowned for its beautiful lake also contains a number of sylvan nooks and crannies where small stages and experimental immersive theatre acts can be found. in amongst the trees at the far end of the site lies the theatre arena   a large blacked out tent with a sizeable raised stage and raked seating. the busy auditorium was presented with a fairly sparse set which had a distinctly industrial feel this was no doubt partly a result of the logistical limitations of the festival setting. that said as the two scaffold structures on stage echoed the metal pole structure of the tent itself the design seemed in keeping. alongside the angular scaffolding a singular piece of cream cloth hung from the light rigging frame down onto the stage later to be used for acrobatics but otherwise offering a soft contrast to the domineering metal structures. effective lighting throughout helped to enhance the set and give a finesse to the performance as a whole. when there are so many much ados staged each year i am always pleased when a production successfully tries to explore something new within the play or makes you think anew about a characters nature. this production although with some work still left to do in some areas such as the nuances of bottoms performance was compensated for with good direction and a focus on the battle between good and evil. there are some apposite assignments of roles including s father who plays this small role wonderfully and drunkenly in the wedding scene indeed  looks and performs the part exceptionally well. my main disappointment is the ever crucial casting of bottom. stevie raine gives a strong and competent performance but he simply doesnt embody the role to its fullest    he is perhaps too good at acting when bottom performs and rather too suave for this humble weaving buffoon. it is perhaps a role that needs settling into and may well improve as the production matures and moves to the national. as mentioned earlier a central focus of this directorial approach seems to be the exploration of representations of good and evil within the play. certain decisions have been made about key characters and their moral status is shown to the audience through the colours of their costumes those that are basically good in athenian white togas for the most part and those deemed bad in black garments. what is thought provoking about this approach though is the way it accentuates the areas of grey in these supposedly black and white characters. this concept was most readily explored within the fairy kindgom. for example  appeared throughout dressed all in black. although many of his actions are reprehensible  stuarts portrayal showed numerous chinks of light where thoughtful and temperate characteristics were able to shine through.  is surprisingly clothed in white at the start i rather preferred a feistier equal to s trickery we see her transformed into black sm gear as she ties up the enchanted bottom proceeding to have raunchy intercourse with him up against the scaffold frame. although it didnt feel gratuitous in nature this much darker approach to this scene explains the 14  age restriction for audience members.  as one might expect appears all in black throughout and is portrayed as the least morally complex of the fair kingdom. indeed he is portrayed as something little short of a maniacal psychopath who takes pleasure from others pain   a truly menacing character an approach i felt worked extremely well. the monochromatic approach to costuming is only broken for a couple of minor roles even some that werent s. cupid appears in ruby red clothes and roller skates at the start the play to indroduce the story by showing the bolt of cupid being fired and landing on the flower love in idleness. this key plot device worked very well. jonno davies  showed particular strength while under the spell of s potion although he seemed more caught up in lust rather than love. similarly when both  and demitrius wes lineham are bewitched and fighting over the bemused and bespectacled   bromley they present a well paced comical performance. there is a good use of movement and a well timed shift in speed. for a production in its early stage of development i found it already a complex and thought provoking work. the pushing of boundaries such as in the love scene between  and  and s dark psychotic tendencies force the audience to explore the nuanced boundaries of good or bad in this most often light hearted play. the strong and confident directorial hand of alexandra spencer jones was apparent creating a production that challenges and rewards the audience in equal measure   making this audience member look forward to seeing the production in its next evolution at the national theatre.,4,Comedy,Positive
Midsummer Night's Dream,Never Anything Can Be Amiss,Kurt Daw,in their current offering the portola valley theatre conservatory creates a conceptually exciting immersive staging that engaging explores the contrast between the soul crushing city and the wild forest at the thematic heart of a midsummer nights dream. portola valley is a rustic coastal california town so bucolic that it is hard to believe it is only a half hour south of bustling san  and within easy hiking distance of stanford university. tucked in between two large land preserves it is a small dot of civilization placed amidst the giant redwoods. pvtc utilizes this arrangement in its site specific setting to the fullest. the concept is initiated when ones reservation is confirmed with a charming and very contemporary e mail in the form of an invitation to duke  upcoming wedding. along with the ubiquitous engagement photo it gives the time and place with a suggestion that the dress code is layers and guests might want to bring insect repellent. arriving at the site which turns out to be a local protestant church one is greeted at the edge of the parking lot by wedding ushers who completely in character apologize profusely that things are not quite ready for the ceremony and in a disturbingly realistic scenario ask the small audience to cool its heels outside while last minute arrangements are completed. when we are finally herded inside we are led first to a small set representing the office of a wedding planner complete with piles of bridal magazines catering menus and other commercial paraphernalia that overburdens modern weddings. the contemporary tone is reinforced by  sarah benjamin who wears a t shirt with a variation on a familiar meme that says i cant keep calm and carry on i am the bride. the audience shares the space with the actors standing around the edges or just sitting down on the floor to watch  intrusively demand that the distracted duke bryce chaddick force his daughter  lydia cuffman against her will to marry   j. brown iii instantly identifiable as a hipster because he is wearing his fashionable sunglasses inside. after the first scene plays out we are urged to follow  and her beloved  matt waters into the woods where they are fleeing in hiking gear complete with backpacks and sleeping bags. they are tailed by  ex  alanna mcnaughton and by  himself. while heading out toward a redwood grove we encounter the rude mechanicals preparing their play in a courtyard and pass a strategically placed fairy queen cheryl goodman morris preening over a changeling boy  max byrne. the second and third acts of the play are staged in the midst of a towering redwood grove which is directly referenced in the performance in a clever substitution for s hawthorn brake. in a similar textual alternation they will discover in the almanac that not only does the moon shine when they need it but that it will be the blue moon that actually graced the performance. although conveniently lit with theatrical instruments and accompanied by shane turners live score it is still the dust stones sticks and pine scent in the clearing where we gather that make the long night in the woods tactile and immediate. kevin gibbs is credited with the aesthetic design. even when off stage fairies hover in the shadows and the sound of the living forest is always present. the scene seems literally enchanting. my favorite piece of staging happenes on the trip back from the woods when we observe bottoms friends anxiously scouting the horizon for any sign of him all sitting on the h hall rooftop. talk about site specific later we are led back inside to an interpolated but nicely moving triple wedding in the chapel featuring a beautiful tenor solo by don gustafson who also plays . from there we finish our evening on a candlelit patio drinking champagne and munching petit fours while along with the duke and his party we enjoy the heartfelt entertainment presented by the rustics. ashley pogue  saier  goodman morris angela khalipa and  kissel make up this motley crew along with  p. quick in the always scene stealing role of flutethisbe. by far the most interesting part of the evening was director noëlle gm gibbs immersive staging perfectly fitted to the play. her conceptual aim sometimes exceeded the grasp of her largely amateur cast but the aim was nonetheless always true. is there any place that better represents the unromantic excesses of social conformity than a wedding planners salon? conversely can there be any better way to realize the mystic power of nature than to take us even a little way out into the forest? what was that sound anyway and what did i just step on? having seen midsummer dozens of times i cannot recall having ever experienced the woods so powerfully. the visceral power of immersive staging however forced it may initially seem can transform an ordinary performance into a fully absorbing aesthetic experience as you begin to feel yourself part of the action and the environment becomes a character in the drama. unsurprisingly the equity guest artist  j. brown iii as  gives the best performance of the evening. brown is the artistic director of the arabian  festival and an actor whose work i have previously admired. matt waters as  and bryce chadwick as  also give especially compelling performances. this production gives unusual prominence to the lovers and their journey of self discovery over the course of the night is treated without condescension. they are funny but more than farcical. the inability to know who we are when overburdened by the demands of civilization and the liberation of finding our natural selves emerge as serious themes for once. browns terrific moment of conversion upon waking from his night in the woods and realizing that he really does love  is about as good as acting gets. the evening was certainly not without its deficits. the scansion was something of a disaster throughout and the fairies were garishly costumed victorian conceptions surprisingly out of keeping with natural woods in which they were located. if ever wildly folkloric instead of tame balletic fairies were called for this was the time still given a play that so thoroughly praises and celebrates the effective sincerity of amateur actors who are giving it their best shot it would be churlish to deny their winning charm in this case. ive certainly witnessed many fully professional productions that were both less interesting in their ideas and less engaging in their presentation. life and art converge in the final scene where both the characters and their real life interpreters rise to the occasion when the moment calls for it and the effect is deeply moving. this is s love letter to the theatre and pvtcs innovative production makes us see it no experience it freshly and intensively.,4,Comedy,Positive
Midsummer Night's Dream,"The Festival of Colors, Festival of Love",Jennifer Kramer,at the philadelphia  theatre the indian city of jodhpur and the hindu religious festival of holi serve as inspiration for director carmen khans production of a midsummer nights dream. the festival is a particularly apt setting for midsummer according to khan holi known as both the festival of colors and the festival of love is a time to come together to laugh love repair broken relationships and celebrate life to the fullest. bethanie wampols simple but effective set design recalls jodhpurs mehrangarh fort district. a single wall with a triptych of pointed trefoil arches is the only solid structure and both it and the stage floor are painted the citys signature blue. two aerial silks hang from the ceiling in purple the color of loves wound as  reminds us. during holi participants douse each other with brightly colored paints and powders and the costume design by vickie esposito picks up on this theme where the set leaves off with a whole bedazzled rainbow of vibrant colors. in form the costumes roughly approximate traditional indian clothing occasionally incorporating more western looks like the lovers sneakers and slacks tom snouts overalls and s trendy neon jogging outfit. esposito also uses color to underscore the plays societal themes. in their first appearances the clothing of all the athenians follows a unified palette in shades of burnt sienna and maroon probably the most somber hues in the entire production. once the lovers resolve to enter the woods however their more functionally practical attire explodes across the color wheel  and  in lemon yellow and turquoise shirts with contrasting chuck taylors in red and purple  in an orange scarf and lime green spangled skirt over matching pants  in a coral tunic with purple slacks and rainbow sneakers. the effect is heightened by  who adds sneakers and hoodies to an ever changing parade of mix and match separates. but in the final scene when the lovers resolve their personal lives and rejoin society they once again follow their leaders sartorial cue they  and  all appear in nuptial white and gold. the cast possesses the energy of impassioned festival goers channeling their enthusiasm into some highly entertaining performances. melissa dunphy as  embodies pure mischievous glee with an engaging vitality and her own theme music. meanwhile the actors intriguing characterization choices for the athenians lead to some larger than life performances without slipping into caricature. jessica gianone gives the lovelorn  a hilariously manic intensity in her quest to manhandle  into returning her love which makes her showdown with  jenna kuerzi in iii.2 that much funnier it is not a lack of physical ability or maidenly shyness that prevents her from fighting but a completely reasonable terror of s berserk mode. but when the two are not fighting over betrayal and short jokes gianone and kuerzi have a warm and natural chemistry that nicely sets their friendship apart from the torrid state of their romantic relationships. among the rude mechanicals  zak plays bottom with an over the top affectation that has apparently gained the respect and awe of his peers and he happily provides the leadership for which they look to him in the uncharted waters of community theater. the whole ensemble nails the deeply funny portrayal of enthusiastic yet hopelessly amateur auteurs. aaron kirkpatrick is particularly excellent as tom snout beautifully capturing the awkward stiffness of a first performance and somehow pulling off several hilarious pratfalls while standing in one place pretending to be the wall. in addition to the physical comedy khan complements the casts high energy with exciting music and some flashy special effects often at the same time. the production opens in darkness with a wild violin solo from dunphy as black clad company members re enact a fairy revel with glowing fingertip lights a cross between interpretive dance and tinkerbell attending a rave. dunphy accents s pandemonium with discordant screeches from her handheld vibraphone and the fingertip lights also represent the fairies magic resulting in some impressively well timed exchanges between   eleni delopoulos and  brian  wilson where sleight of hand creates the illusion of magical light hurled back and forth. the effects with the aerial silks are somewhat less successful as the cast seems rather tentative in exploiting their full acrobatic potential however they are not totally ignored as when delopoulos  sings her own lullaby as she knots them into an airborne cradle. khan ends the production with a powerful sung version of s final soliloquy performed by dunphy and a bollywood inspired dance sequence a perfect blending of an tradition and the productions modern influences. the one area where this marriage of cultures falls short is the cast one wishes the production more closely reflected philadelphias multicultural makeup by also featuring onstage representation of its south asian population. however for the most part the setting adds an enjoyable and thought provoking angle to the production.  and s fight over her indian page boy is transmuted from an exotic aside to a local concern drawing attention to their similarly amoral treatment of the athenians. the use of aerial silks meanwhile recalls tim supples famous multilingual british indian and sri lankan co production of midsummer. spring festivals like holi  both natural and personal transformation. by connecting this to the themes of a midsummer nights dream the philadelphia  theatre presents both a celebration of  and love   in all their many shades.,4,Comedy,Positive
Midsummer Night's Dream,Midsummer Mishaps,Melissa Crismon,a well crafted stage in the middle of the park greets the audience at a  by the sea production. people buzz around the platform with dogs where families are eating a homemade picnic dinner. there is a glimpse of roman costumes as actors walk around selling raffle tickets to win a trip for two to hawaii. the filigree woodcut half moon is apropos for a night of  in the park. the yellow moon sits back on the stage. there is more yellow filigree forming a tree to the side and leaves and vines covering the front of the lower stage. its no wonder the stage delights with credits including abcs extreme makeover home edition from scenic designer aaron jackson. from the beginning its a silly production. the audience is greeted by an actor who says he sleeps in the park exactly where one man happens to be sitting. the actor suddenly becomes enraged insisting the man get out of his sleeping spot. its a ludicrous exchange. then the mood becomes mildly serious when  andy kallok throws his daughter   schlueter corey to the ground demanding she marry  garret replogle. but the story of  schlueter corey  robert mchalffey  bridget garwood and  garret replogle stands above all as these four lovers affections are criss cd by the mischievous  g.  joseph. s garwood gets on all fours begging  to be her lover. she barks then tugs on his clothes with her teeth. she jumps on his back as he tries to escape. as expected  joseph pours juice in repogles eyes and he awakens madly in love with garwood. feeling mocked she slaps him in the face getting an aghast reaction from the audience. the great king  b.j. allman is jealous of his queen s kathryn farren affections for the unseen changeling bottom. allman also plays  and farren plays  as an angry russian. more silliness.  farren is delighted by bottom patrick vest when he nays like a horse and when the mechanicals see him they run through the park. suddenly a little girl in the audience stands up and also runs after one of the mechanicals. all this running causes two dogs to run play and rough house. the child then returns following the actor back to the stage. in the play within the play flute greg prusiewicz fondles the brick in the wall to great comic relief. when bottom dies flute speak cries in a high pitch voice which does not disappoint. when the confusion between the four lovers is peaceful again  and  wake up next to each other. at one point they almost kiss. but the silliness interrupts again and drags. direction by patrick vest is true to the period. the comedy is drawn out of the four young lovers the mechanicals and the mishaps between bottom and . the costumes are period with a roman theme.  wears an ombre orange dress with a gold belt and a crown around her blond wig and ankle sandals. minus the wig and crown she could walk offstage and blend in with many of todays trends. even the guys rock the sandals.  sandals have buckles made of taupe leather that lead up to below the knee. the men wear faux leather chest protectors with straps hanging around the waist. the mechanicals are color coordinated with reds golds and browns. the costumer jamie brown has a little fun putting  in purple pants a faux fur vest and matching fur hat with horns. lisa coffi founder and producing artistic director said that  drew in a crowd of 1450 people the night before in newport beach california. they expect a larger crowd in the same town for midsummer since it is a comedy. newport beach is a city that loves to support the arts and theatres like  by the sea. all in all  by the seas production of a midsummer nights dream is a journey of mishaps and confusion that makes the audience laugh children run and dogs play.,4,Comedy,Positive
Midsummer Night's Dream,"A Bold, Inclusive Midsummer ",Diana Louise Carter,mix actors with experienced american sign language actors and you dont just get a traditional production with finger spelling on the side. you might just end up with more of a dream team as in the  players of rochesters version of a midsummer nights dream. director luane davis haggerty mounts a bold production in which each human character is paired with a fairy counterpart with the fairy speaking the lines in sign language. but haggerty hasnt just gone with a word for word translation. in some instances the fairies amplify the voice actors lines or thoughts with bolder moves or reactions. when bottom pompously playing the hero pyramus dies repeatedly during the play within a play near the end for instance voice actor bill alden focuses on delivering bottoms final words in many forms while his signing counterpart troy chapman mimes bottoms death again and again with growing frustration that his human version doesnt seem to be taking the hint. this fairy bottom bouncing up and down after repeated death throes finally tries stabbing the human bottom hilariously.  players of rochester a program of rochester community players has mounted outdoor  plays in rochester ny since 1994. this production with the entire play acted out both in voice and sign language at the same time is believed to be a first for any  company. the production works well mostly. haggerty an experienced teacher and director of theater at national technical institute for the deaf in rochester starts the play by introducing each character. the human character voices his or her name as the fairy character signs the same name allowing the audience to understand that one character is being played simultaneously by two people and in two different fashions. the action begins with the human characters on the left side of the stage and the fairy characters on the right which feels a little like watching a table tennis game. before long though both sets of actors are traveling across the stage and intermingling. the human characters are not aware of the fairies but they occasionally interact with the fairies even tripping the humans or supporting them when they collapse. the action often spills off the stage   i kept waiting for the madly dashing s jonathan lowery speaking nic shaw signing to twist an ankle when jumping off the head high stage   or starts behind the audience on the lawn and runs toward the stage. trish annese is wonderfully regal and often sexy as . fairy version nicole hood gave a more ethereal but still royal and sexy portrayal.  stephen cena as the human  though was simply too restrained and didnt convince us that his  was motivated by jealousy. his fairy version played by jamal jones was more convincing with his pantomimed emotions. the cast is gifted in physical comedy with the  duo human jamie tyrell fairy brittany dzugas smith earning special honors. the actresses who played the human  and  rebecca miller are near equal height which might not have worked when they fight and disparage each other for being too tall or too short. tyrell though jumps on the back of her fairy alter ego and gains the height advantage. where the play was difficult was in the sheer number of people on stage. the director did admirable work with the blocking and was quite inventive   the back and forth between mixed up human lovers got a boost from fairies pushing them or holding them back. but sometimes there was simply too much going on for one set of eyes and ears to catch. in one scene the frustrated s and s are center stage having an animated discussion while the human  and  are having a slow motion brawl to one side and the fairy  and  are trying to choke each other in the other corner. it was hard to know where to look. on the other hand it was entertaining to observe how varied the matched sets of actors were   sometimes different genders sometimes different races or ethnicities and sometimes both. they even differed noticeably by age in some cases. it would be hard to beat this production for diversity. costuming apparently done without a central designer revealed some interesting choices   colonial ish attire for most of the humans   and some even worked. the centurion costume that the human bottom donned as pyramus gave the appropriate over the top impression. the same with the purple and magenta prom gown from hell that francis flute a very funny tinh lik to wore to play thisbe. fairies were denoted with sparkly wings and flowing tunics and pants. more sparkles decorated the nerdy fairy version of francis flute played by joseph fox ii when he was the signing thisbe. with so many characters and actors on stage it was a relief to see a streamlined set   mostly a few trees and pillars that doubled as tree trunks supporting a second story populated by musicians with early music instruments. you havent lived by the way until youve heard pharells happy played on recorders tin whistle and hand drums. the accompanying dance verges on chaos with ribbons being twirled hither and yon but it ends with an elegant duet between the child peasblossom taylor windheim and the signing . as an experiment this midsummer was successful and perhaps will create a demand for more accessible and satisfying theater.,4,Comedy,Positive

hips. the grass bounces up and down with the movement accenting white slit skirts. their curly hair pours around them and under an ornate headdress with feathers flowers seashells and grass. the young male dancers are in coordinating white slit pants showing their defined thigh muscles. the opening polynesian dance is called te aril the prince about prince hauarii who is the prince of peace born on a peaceful and prosperous island. the sound of drums and shouts of joy came from the villagers when the prince arrived.the athenian officers watch the natives dance from afar. different drums are beating different rhythms while the female dancers dance together and the young men dance lining up on the other side of the stage. when the dancing stops  zarr grabs the indian boy played by solomona

dressed in gingham shirts and nickers with dickensian shoes. from the athenian society to the fairy kingdom to the mechanicals every group has an encompassing theme. the traditional polynesian dancers wear their own crisp colored regalia. they either wear a solid color of white yellow or green to signify something in the dance like yellow skirts symbolize love and friendship.director susan angelos interpretation of midsummer creates cohesion out of chaos. in the playbill she writes playing with elizabethan traditions of fairy folklore court pageantry superstition and sity about what lies outside england the play becomes a kaleidoscope through which we see different worlds bumping into one another creating friction and chaos but ultimately uniting through the power of love. having the hitia o te ra dance company with drums led by alex tekurio and choreography by malia tafu is an excellent and seamless enhancement to the story of midsummer. the prince of peace folklore is perfect to interchange for the changeling boy who is sent away until he can return with peace. orange countys production is a unique midsummer with a polynesian theme. director angelo brings together the local community celebrating many cultures. the show is truly a multi cultural experience.,5,Comedy,Positive
Midsummer Night's Dream,"Beautiful, Powerful, Magical, Dangerous",Roseanne Wells,a director known for her big screen and broadway productions that strut and flash and swing julie taymor tackles a midsummer nights dream for the inaugural production of theater for a new audiences new space in brooklyn. taymor is a designers director who turns her creatives loose and produces fantastical feats of theater. original music by elliot goldenthal is in turns haunting and playful performed live by jonathan mastro and wilson torres. intricate lighting by donald holder sets the mood whether cheerful or sinister. constance hoffmans costume design is character based rather than time specific and her talents shine with s textured rose gown complete with opalescent shoulder collar hood and train as well as s sun mantle and fan swords. there are wonderful feats of aerial tricks from airealistic and a donkey mask with lips that sync with the actors voice. theres even a credit in the program for daniel wurtzel fabric  fans artist. the woods are full of fright and fairy tricks thanks to es devlins grass covered furniture and shadow lantern mazes and clacking trees sprouting up everywhere. sven ortels flashy projections are excessive for me though they occasionally add atmosphere. not surprisingly taymor has embraced the big dramatic wonderful and scary forest but has forsaken the trees the quiet moments the softness the sweet depths of the play. actors of varying skill are set adrift and their performances are often determined by their previous experience and skill. the lovers are left to fend for themselves. the quartet is mostly green actors save for mandi masden and they really come to life after the flowers juice and its manic love. lilly englert as  is fussy and delicate nothing more than a meringue in poofy short skirts and a stiff ruff matching her fathers. her voice ranges from scratchy to shrieky and she misses the central sacrifice that  is making for  which makes his seeming fickle heart that much more devastating. jake horowitz as  is not as deserving of her true love anyway he has some great moments but his laid back demeanor borders on apathy before the potion.  has a crisp aristocratic manner which wears thin in the forest but hes all ham when he falls in love with . masden herself is more nuanced in athens but is also prone to hysterics and wild gesturing in the woods. the lovers are on red alert all the time which gives a lot of urgency but lacks depth. and they really need that love juice to come alive. the other athenians do a little better.  roger clark in a long black leather coat is regal enough but doesnt have the command that one might expect. he acts more like s rich doting uncle than the duke of athens. clarks performance brings a genuine sense of concern for her welfare and future if it diminishes his air of authority. however  okwui okpokwasili is a warrior queen to the hilt. proud and noble she takes  as an equal and perhaps a better in some ways. the fairy rulers however put their mortal counterparts to shame.  flies down from the heavens glorious in cold light and colder anger. tina benko channels cate blanchetts galadriel and tilda swintons white witch equal parts beautiful and terrifying and enchanting and dangerous. benkos vocal range is impressive from low and soothing to twinkling heights to passionate intensity. her love madness is hilarious too an immortal being reduced to a flustered teenager.  rises on the moveable catwalk from the depths radiant and glowering in rage. david harewoods thunderous voice takes command of the moment. he can laugh with and reprimand  in the same moment and he shows true regret in having to put  through his games but not enough to let her keep the changeling. yes this pair could definitely rule heaven and earth move the forces of nature when they have a lovers spat. and  is s errand child and old drinking buddy all in one. this  is a fun chaos driven ungrown bundle of energy. he laughs and plays with the children in the cast called rude elementals teaching them and leading them. robin is a sneaky trickster and kathryn hunter crafts a marvelous creature of craggy youth wisdom in the eyes but mischief in the heart. thank goodness for the mechanicals dressed in paint spattered overalls camo plaid coveralls and one overly dandy suit. lending much needed comic relief are   joe grifasi flute zachary infante   youmans snout jacob ming trent and the fearsome snug brendan averett who does indeed fright the ladies as lion. and of course bottom as a rough and tumble blue collar italian with a poets soul. max casella not only embodies the guido with lofty ambitions but he also handles the functional donkey mask with great dexterity. many thanks to the company of hard handed men for bringing this production back down to earth. the theater itself is a unique tool that is easily used and misused in turn. the orchestra seating on three sides is sunken below stage level so the action is immersive. parts of the stage can also sink below and it works for dramatic entrances and exits and for the court to sit in to make pyramus and thisbe more visible. unfortunately it is hard to see into when the lovers awaken from their midsummer nights madness. the two galleries above also serve the cast mostly as a watching place for the rude elementals to tease robin with their creepy and hauntingly beautiful sing song verse or throw pillows to the lovers in act iii for the pillow fight of course. but it also seems like a holding place for the children. there are other parts of the production that seem shoehorned in  just because. i love when the rude elementals change into children for the wedding reverse changelings entering the mortal world for one evening of celebration. but why is still unexplained. the house opens with a simple bed covered in white linens under a cool spot shedding light on a world absent of magic.  enters in a crepey oatmeal suit and bowler hat lays down on the bed which then rises on hydraulic brambles before one of the mechanicals comes and chain saws the bed from the bushes and a white curtain magically appears and the bed flies up and we are in athens. it seems that there is some metaphor or symbolic meaning that was lost on me. otherwise it would just be an elaborate set up for the white curtain as a big top to signal that the circus has begun. this is clearly julie taymors dream and though it hath no bottom it is a rare vision.,4,Comedy,Positive
Midsummer Night's Dream,Puppets Dreaming Dreams,J. A. Macfarlane,lets start at the start i have been waiting for quite literally years for someone to make the obvious anne hathaway jokes. and yet they always fail to materialise   until today when i finally got to see not only a joke on the matter but an extended one. for this performance of a midsummer nights dream is being performed not at the wedding of  and  but of that of our old friend the red velvet jacketed green faced shakey shake to his lovely bride anne hathaway. the modern day anne hathaway that is fresh from her triumph in les misérables. who does indeed at one moment warblingly remind shakey shake that you wrote the dream in times gone by  all that was missing was a susan boyle joke. we had to make do with the rob ford ones instead. the avowed intent of shakey shake and friends founder tom mcgee is to get children interested in the stories of s plays before they meet him anywhere else to keep them from being scared off or bored and the more i see of these puppet plays whether last years the tempest  a puppet epic or this years rovero   by the manipulators the more i am convinced that they have hit on exactly the right formula. children in the audience are clearly entranced move them from this to susan herberts  cats to the animated  series to the lambs tales from  to performances of some of the actual plays and they will be ready to face the dreary days of overanalysing  and  in high school secure in the knowledge that the plays are actually fun. once again we are faced with the multiple levels of this performance with actors both manipulating the puppets and acting the puppets roles even as these puppets play  however much they may continually interrupt one another. this allows them to make sure the young audience is following not to mention comment on the plays foibles. im not sure id ever noticed how often this happens before but it is rather convenient how people keep falling asleep at just the right moment. and how oddly specific a plant that gets rid of love potions is. and the plots and plans particularly s are indeed rather convoluted. its nice to have this pointed out. as pranks go of course its understood that  and  have been up to all sort of things before. remember when we drew an angry face on a pillow and got it elected mayor? stands as one of the most appreciated lines at least for torontonians. drama is added to this production of the dream by the fact that the puppet companys diva lucy whos playing  is feeling extremely threatened by the presence of anne hathaway. to be fair the latter isnt helping matters constantly reminding everybody of all the films shes been in. anne herself plays  while shakey shake takes on  with young zip as his . the puppets company is really a bit typecast   last year those two played prospero and ariel. the problem with adapting dream for children is simple   there are too many stories going on. mcgee manages to keep the major elements while paring the whole thing down from having dream itself be the play presented at the wedding thus eliminating the need for the mechanicals subplot to removing the  frame and egeon. the matter of s switched affections is also made comprehensible he only dumped  because daddy told him to as it will help them get ahead in business. and much as the lambs dealt with the necessity of finding an excuse for bottom to be in the woods by simply announcing that a foolish villager had fallen asleep within the forests confines here we had marlowe the worlds greatest actor according to himself naturally who even gets to give us bottoms desire to play every role   but for the dream. i must admit i am very glad that i was able to see the tempest a puppet epic last year as it allowed me to catch a number of inside jokes that only those in the know would quite get   the return of trunkulo as a group of trunk fairies chief among them. in fact half the pleasure was in rediscovering characters from last year i shall try to avoid repeating myself too much here and recommend that people read last years review if they are intrigued enough to wish to know more. however i admit i was a bit worried at times that there might be a few too many inside jokes. the constant laughter from the audience suggests that either everyone was in on them or that it didnt matter but there was a certain sense of you had to be there. for instance i dont know why the company has such affection for the line but soft what light through yonder window breaks? from  and  but it was incorporated into the tempest and returned this year as well   but soft what sprite through yonder central aisle breaks? as  returns with the flower. that minor quibble aside this is an extremely fine fun and boisterous production. i was left us about the decision to suddenly bring in an element of set decoration at the end having had the entire play presented on a bare stage before then but it brought a nice touch of colour. the little details throughout are wonderful   particularly the trunk fairies and  literally being dragged behind  refusing to let go of his leg. there is also a great deal of actual  mixed in with the text the transition between blank verse and simplified text and pop culture references are almost always seamless. and my what fun those references are. i remain uncertain about my favourite moment   the  quarrel with s vituperative you puppet of course included follow by a brief interruption of the action for it to be pointed out that those words are indeed in the original line and scene reference provided or  deceiving  and  in their fight and s in the immortal words of gandhi challenge accepted on reflection i think this last stands as the highlight. unlike in traditional puppet shows the performers are visible at all times and their ability to manipulate their puppets physicalise the roles themselves and speak the lines while keeping each puppets personality intact is quite reable. congratulations also to the performer whom i did identify incidentally who had hurt her back and yet went through with the production. and the whole cast gave a fine chorus when the play of course ended with a rendition of i dreamed a dream reworded to suit the plot. i dont especially like the song but it was nicely done. mcgee has suggested that given the popularity of shakey shake and friends he would like to stretch their wings a little next year and take on something more challenging than the well known plays theyve so far paid attention to. one can only hope their names come out of the lottery next year and that well be treated to titus andronicus the puppet epic. or perhaps measure for measure. either way i suspect the immortal words of gandhi will ring in mcgee and his companys ears.,4,Comedy,Positive

Midsummer Night's Dream,Unexpected Magic in Geva's Dream,Diana Louise Carter,you expect some magic with a midsummer nights dream. geva theatre center in rochester ny provides just that. gevas version of dream features delightful child fairies and an  a regal keith hamilton cobb and  an archcarly street so passionate in their rule of the natural world that they change the color of the moon with their moods. but what you might not expect is that the best magic doesnt come from a tiny fairy at all. it comes from an actor more than 6 feet tall dressed in drag with overpainted lips and pigtails sopreposterously askew that they resemble antennae. ron menzel as francis flute playing the play within a plays thisbe nearly stops the show. the scene is set up by bottom brian oconnor executing an uproarious death scene as pyramus thisbes lover. pyramus uses his sword to assail every limb then kneeling grasps the blade between his thighs so his torso can fall on it. not satisfied that he has fully killed himself he starts over again before finally meeting his self administered demise. when thisbe enters you expect her to echo pyramus death with a funny one of her own. this is after all a character who needs a hand   quite literally   from a cranky   munson hicks to reach the appropriate falsetto. instead menzels thisbe acts with such pathos at the discovery of her dead beloved that she brings the house to the brink of tears before swiftly dispatching herself.  is moved to a standing ovation by the display and the audience nearly is too. a quick recap for those whove never stumbled upon a production of this beloved play the duke of athens is about to get married and a band of fools is preparing a play for the festivities. a nobleman asks the duke to rule on whether his daughter should marry the man her father has chosen for her rather than the man she loves. the daughter and her lover escape to the forest to avoid the dukes harsh ruling followed by the other young man and his former girlfriend. everyone falls prey to fairy magic and a lovers quarrel between fairy royalty that first adds to the mess and ultimately untangles it. emily kunkel as  steals almost every scene in which she appears channeling the gawky comic timing of carol burnett while bemoaning her difficulties in gaining the man she loves. when the suddenly bewitched  a lusty sheldon best leaves his girlfriend and says nature has shown him s heart kunkel recoils and clutches her shawl to her cleavage lest he see more than her heart. when the object of her frustrated affections  ian holcomb is likewise entranced she does a little happy dance. co directors  cuddy and skip greer have upped the plays humor with excellent choices of staging and action. they have  george abud enter and exit by a different exotic method each time popping in and out of a variety of trapdoors scaling the athenian forest like a jungle gym and peering out of a hidden window on level with the balcony. one of the best laughs comes when  kaliswa brewer signals shes about to do some bodily harm to  with the school girl equivalent of throwing down a gauntlet she removes her earrings and tosses them angrily aside. carrying out the theme of discovery and surprise is the set designed by jo winiarksi and lit beautifully by ann g. wrightson. at first the set appears stark just a slightly raised circle in the floor and curtains of blue red and white in a toga like drape. but when the formal city of athens gives way to the surrounding woods you can almost smell the moss. walls of tree trunks line the stage and tiny fairy lights in the bark sparkle. nothing is ever quite what it seems in this setting with fairies appearing from nowhere. costuming costume designer pamela scofield and wig designer bekah carey doesnt turn out quite as well. from a distance the animal print body suits worn under ornate embellishments read as muddy and the bright green wigs draw too much visual attention. more effective is the leather ensemble evoking the prenuptial archery activities of hippoltya and the satyr outfit worn by  which includes a wig of long dreadlocks. this dream takes a risk casting paul forquet elissa myers casting local children as young as seven to play alongside equity actors whove walked the boards on broadway off broadway and at regional theaters around the country. but the kids do more than keep up particularly seventeen year old rebecca rand a graceful and angel voiced first fairy who goes toe to toe with . she leads the other child actors in singing an eerie composition by  zeretzke with complex harmonies. gevas production of dream ending it 40th season strikes similarly pretty harmonies.,4,Comedy,Positive
Midsummer Night's Dream,Erindale's Midsummer Night Chases Winter Away,J. A. Macfarlane,when attending a given performance requires a forty five minute subway trip followed by an hour long bus ride with the knowledge that said trip will have to be taken again in reverse on the way back its something of a given that the performance had better be worth it. theatre erindale can pat itself on the back their midsummer nights dream more than rewards the trip out and going over it in ones mind on the return takes care of getting back. this is an absolutely superb production even with the occasional less fortunate detail and is well worth attending. given the small number of seats available i strongly recommend booking yours now. for this production theatre erindale combines wonderful patter with vigorous physical comedy and a wealth of small details that keeps everything on stage of interest at every moment. the characterisation is especially fine particularly when it comes to the quartet of lovers. these four are so interchangeable that they are often played as such but here we are given four strongly defined personalities whose contrasts only increase the comedy. comedy is the keynote here   erindale goes full out for laughs. there is sometimes a tendency to seek out the darker potential of s comedies apparently due to the idea that his worth lies in the depths he brings forth which is why his tragedies are his greatest plays. this production is thoroughly free of such illusions director sue miner remembers that the reason dream is so continually popular is that its funny. and so we have the contrast of the rather poncey  with his reably well coiffed hair and the doting long suffering  the melodramatic  and the prissy  the uptight egea s mother replacing the more habitual egeon and the suitably smug  all playing out their parts in a 19th century english town where the mourning widow  has had to sell her factory to . unexpectedly it seems that there is a fairy haunted wood nearby neatly brought about by draping the balcony and columns of the thrust stage with greenery where  stentorian and upright haired is quarrelling with  shiny gown and shawl. the fairies present perhaps the best example of miners ability to fashion added narratives and add tiny jests that are enough to keep up the interest without ever detracting from the play.  for instance hairy legged and bowler hatted is deeply wearied by  and is forever trying to escape his speechifying and his orders. thus he tries to sneak away while  begins his long winded explanation of where  can find love in idleness   only to be dragged back by the fairy king who then starts the speech all over. s waiting fairies are a deeply amusing twittering bunch communicating amongst themselves in sounds somewhere between insects a distantly yipping dog a poorly oiled gate and a flock of gossiping songbirds which is all much less grating than it should be. just as  is not the happiest of s employees s fairies have distinct thoughts on their mistress. their disgust at the whole bottom incident and eagerness to flee once  gets physical with him is particularly hilarious but then so is poor moth i think it is being abandoned and forced to guard  all on her own. at the same time for all these lovely little details miners cast is not afraid to go over the top when need be playing big without ever actually chewing the scenery except in the play with a play of course. what especially comes back to mind is the cartoonish relationship between  and  as they move from trembling to bawling at the thought of being parted s exhaustion at dragging the over heavy trunk  insists on bringing with her or s despair at being abandoned by  being thoroughly mocked by the invisible fairies behind her. along with that is the plentiful physical comedy particularly when the humans are being manipulated by the fairies.  and  turn the  battles into slapping contests  trying to escape the quarrel runs away only to return again to the scene from every entrance the theatre has with some doubtless unfeigned gasping  coming across  and  forces  to begin undressing to the humans utter horror. and then there are the mechanicals who in this production are workers at s former factory now s. firstly congratulations to dialect coach denise norman who produced a lovely range of lower class regional english accents with the mechanicals. and then to the full group who are just as finely characterised as the rest of the cast. april leungs child snug megan okellys suddenly roped into acting  who loses her temper at the posh folks mocking her  snetzkos awkward snout kaitlyn alexanders  endlessly overshadowed by fraser woodside as bottom whose grotesqueness when transformed into an ass clearly explains the disgust of s attendants at her passion and brian postalians flute who as thisbe and especially when rehearsing thisbe will seem familiar to anyone who has ever participated in amateur or school dramatics are a lively and more importantly credible bunch who pull off their play with verve. but it is unfair to point out specific actors in a production as company minded as this where no actor stands out due to the uniform excellence of the cast. wes paynes  is giddily mischievous while marcus haccius as  is both overbearing and not commonly unfeeling his physical admission that s mistake was partly his   a somewhat grumpy oh fine is not something ive seen an  admit to before. the four lovers   lindsey middleton as  who suits the text by being as short as ali richardson  is tall josh wiles as a superb  and victor pokinko both snobbish and distraught as    are excessively well matched. there are some small quibbles that i have with this production egeas apparent crush on  and sappy acceptance of  struck me as overworked and while the musical accompaniment to acts of magic was necessary i could have done with something a little less clichéd than the little glissando that is used. the idea that s sudden acceptance of  comes from  deciding to use his remaining love potion on her is us and i dont believe ive seen it before but while fascinating it strikes me as underlining the problematic aspects of cheering on the fairies influence and as these were not considered elsewhere i was left a touch bemused. these are minor however more serious is the fact that s speech on the lover the poet and the madman is cut short. amusingly cut short as the smug aristocrat is silenced by a kiss on the mouth by his newly besotted wife but it seems unfair to bereave him of his best speech   unfair both to evan s playing him and to the play as a whole. at this point of the plot a midsummer nights dream is a meditation on the nature of reality of dreams and of theatre philosophically speaking and i agree that a performance of dream is not and should not be the place to come for a philosophy lesson this is the richest and most serious part of the play and s speech is a key element in this. cutting it takes aiming for the laugh too far. but the cut is soon forgotten with the reappearance of the mechanicals. s company of players has a difficult task because at this stage they always seem tacked on. its s fault really the play within a play is not as well integrated into the whole as subsequent masques and shows are even that in loves labours lost. midsummer nights dream always seems to be ending with the lovers leaving the wood. it feels as though it should be and so the mechanicals have the task of bringing the audience back in   never an easy task. how do the erindale mechanicals pull off the challenge? brilliantly. pyramus and thisbe at times threatens to steal the entire show from snouts slow collapse down the steps forcing bottom and flute to kiss through the chink while lying on the floor to the aristocrats walking onto stage for their discussion of moonshine and moonshines subsequent fury at them to flutes decorous and dulcet thisbe. but just as pyramus threaten to steal the show of dream so does fraser woodsides bottom threaten to steal the show from pyramus. leaving aside his magnificently spanish accent alternating with his lower class one and his overwrought passion woodside gives us what is bar none the single finest case of overkill i have ever seen in any production of dream including all the films or any other show in any medium. tempting though it is to describe in detail all i will say is that monty pythons its just a flesh wound scene has now been surpassed and there is a reason much of the audience had difficulty breathing at this point. while i dont want to go so far as to say this suicide alone justifies the trip out it comes quite close to doing so. with the return of the fairies the company also pulls off the challenge of returning to romance at the end as the full cast of mortals joins in a reconciliatory dance as the fairies move between them. it is a fine ending to a very fine production where music a mix of mendelssohn and others effects and brilliant acting combine to make one forget the winter outside and weave the subtly magical spell of s most enchanted play.,5,Comedy,Positive
Midsummer Night's Dream,Harnessing the Power of Imagination,Eric Minton,the bottom line is that a midsummer nights dream should make you laugh. yes pun intended. so if you can accept the over conceptualized setting with anachronistic and logistical inconsistencies gorgeous verse that is given trudging treatment by some performers and superfluous stage business including gratuitous mud wrestling that stomps all over some of the plays best lines if you can accept all that you will regard this production as an enjoyable hoot. especially bottom. you also will find an ingenious representation of  that came about almost by accident. director ethan mcsweeny likes to dress up his  in finely detailed conceptual settings of specific places and times a merchant of venice in eastside new york city circa 1920 a much ado about nothing in cuba circa 1930 and now this midsummer nights dream in a decayed theater circa 1945. this can force both the verse and significant aspects of the plot into dead end alleys such as  tim campbell and  sara topham opening the play with formal speeches of peace at wars end their war of course which stretches s fleeting allusion of athens amazon battles into a stilted piece of stage business. the lovers stumbling through this wood near athens when they are actually in an abandoned theater in athens? leads to many incongruous moments too. however concepts can have theatrical payoffs and in this case we are rewarded with a presentation of the spirits not as woodland fairies but theater ghosts.  and  campbell and topham are dressed as regency actors doing moliere and the other sprites wear whatever theyve nicked from the wardrobe department. s bower is a grand piano that is raised above the stage and the old chandeliers become trapeze for the acrobatic fairies. though too much detail creates awkward anachronisms mcsweeny intends his conceptual settings to effectively explore thematic subtexts of s plays. his new york merchant amplified that plays economic caste system and interrelationships of metropolitan sub populations. his cuban much ado brought out the role of women in a society riveted to religious and economic custom. for this dream the overriding theme is the power of imagination. the word imagination and its synonyms seem to get particular emphasis and  speech on the lunatic lover and poet comes on the heels of having seen all three become one fourfold. thanks to the theater setting we get not just a play pyramus and thisbe within a play but the whole proceeding of this midsummer nights dream is a play within a play we are in a theater watching a theater watching theater. ironically this multilayered structure magnifies a simple reality that not only is theater built on imagination but imagination is our own private theater. this plays out in subtle ways with the four lovers wandering about the um woods. as  chris myers in prep club blazer and constantly carrying a golf club as his weapon argues with  amelia pedlow who found s quick fuse temper early in the play about s whereabouts  perched on a chandelier slickly pulls the club up out of  hand. when  realizes it is missing he starts looking for it while continuing his dialogue with  who ends up under the chandelier  slips the golf club into her hands. she has no idea how it got there but she has a weapon now to flail at . this sequence does more than elicit two good laughs. it and similar pieces of stage business illustrate how the woodland scenes are imagination run amok. s love potion mistakenly applied by  might be the catalyst of all the mayhem but its really s taking his four lovers to an extreme state of raw emotion that we enjoy like a daydream that escalates in ever fanciful plateaus. in our lost in the woods way of thinking irritation with our boss might prompt us to imagine what we might say in the staff meeting but by the end of our commute we are running the company and the boss is in jail or we might ponder whether a certain someone would ever notice us and by the end of our walk we envision that someone latched to our side as we rise to nobel prize winning superstardom. lord what fools we mortals be. and as in our fantasies  draws out the lovers conversations and dawning realizations without waylaying the mounting emotions. in the physical accompaniment to the verbal scramble over who loves whom and who no longer loves whom and indeed hates whom  and  christiana clark end up stripped to their 1946 lingerie. stripped to their boxer shorts are  and  robert beitzel who in plaid shirt and jeans and constantly strumming his guitar as he meanders through s verse seems like he stepped out of that 70s show.  all are soaking wet and covered in cement like mud. how did they get there? not     but how did pedlow clark myers beitzel end up wallowing in mud? enter  green as . in a post show talkback green revealed that the blocking for this scene never quite gelled until well into rehearsals mcsweeny decided to bring  down from his box seat eating popcorn with  and influence the action handing the women buckets of water to splash at each other mixing the cement and pouring it onto the stage. though this is not in the plays original stage directions it makes for an honest  because  hints that this goodfellow isnt as entirely innocent as he maintains. this is thy negligence  tells him at the end of the scene after the fairy king has already admonished him at the beginning of the scene for mistaking the two athenian men. still thou mistakst or else commitst thy knaveries willfully. still indicates continuing. the first fairy introduces us to  with a litany of his mischievous acts yet s text shows no manifestation of his mischievous ways except with bottom and that prank is in keeping with his masters plot against . green during the talkback said that by becoming involved in the lovers fight he was better able to embrace his character. truly this is the 16th dream ive seen on stage but the first time ive seen a  who lives up to s billing. while love can send ones imagination into a frenzy a more institutional version of imagination run amok is good theater or in the case of pyramus and thisbe really really bad theater. mcsweeny throws every amateur theater faux pas into this dreams climactic presentation of the rude mechanicals production from falling sets and wardrobe malfunctions to wrong sound cues and miss timed blocking when thisbe kisses walls hole she really does. the production is so awful to be so funny that the insults of the palace courtiers seem more like impulsive reactions shared with fellow audience members than mean spirited barbs. credit brilliant casting david graham jones as flute playing a flighty thisbe herschel sparber as the tinker snout who has fashioned his wall out of strings of cans draping from his arms robert dorfman as snug delighted at his opportunity to roar like a lion and christopher bloch as  totally out of his element even playing something so simple as moonshine. ted van griethuysen brings to the part of   a love of theater that seems entirely natural in any organizer of an amateur dramatic society singing some broadway tune at each of his entrances theres no business like show business s his initial entrance he whistles as he works to set up the rehearsal he shakily ekes out youll never walk alone after bottoms transformation. this  with a passion for theatrics would certainly be taken with bottom. for nobody has an imagination that gallops quite as much as bottoms and bruce dow plays him to the hilt as a generally good natured fellow whose vision of himself far surpasses his own reality. he reminds me of jackie gleason not in ralph kramden mode but in the character of reginald van gleason iii the full of his own fantasies millionaire dashing in his topcoat hat and cane sweeping his arms as he talks to fill as much space with as much of his self as he can emote. bottom prattles on about different types of beards this proves his supposedly superior knowledge of theater. he doesnt chew the scenery he becomes the scenery. and he gamely perseveres in acting pyramus despite vying with his own visor despite the falling scenery or walls formidable anger when his costume is damaged despite  mistakenly playing the  tell overture upon pyramus entrance at ninnys tomb and despite  interpolation. still the pinnacle of dows performance comes earlier when in rehearsal  corrects his line reading and dows bottom spends some five minutes of affected consternation willing himself back into character. the line between bottom and pyramus as well as bottom and the ass is a fine one and blurred too. the same could be said regarding the lovers between their sane and drugged state. however there is no line between the athenian lords and the fairy royalty. doubling these roles is a long tradition that probably dates to s initial production but mcsweeny doesnt so much double the characters as merge them. campbell is a particularly enchanting  even in his anger and the reason we can accept his bullying of  is that we see an easy benevolence in his  even in his handling of s marriage choice. it also helps s case that this production has a young boy maxwell balay playing the changeling and though he happily plays with s attendants he seems perfectly delighted to become s henchman. green portrays  as straight laced stiff as  is limber and loose but both have a penchant for startling his boss a fun running joke and when greens  with a gleam in his eye describes witnessing the rude mechanicals rehearsal we suddenly remember that  did witness their rehearsal and took part too. after the young lovers head to their marriage beds  and  remain on stage as does  who picks up a broom and begins speaking s verse. he transforms into robin goodfellow before our eyes while the emerging fairies help the royal couple exchange into their

Midsummer Night's Dream,"On a Summer Night, Buffalo's ""Midsummer"" is Magical",Diana Louise Carter,so often it seems that the two pairs of fairy dusted lovers in a midsummer nights dream come off as well whiny. their love is either unrequited or forbidden. they get lost. they start to go to pieces when things dont go their way. it is no wonder that either the mischievous  or the company of fools in this play   particularly the funny guy with the donkeys head    usually end up stealing the show. and try to steal the show they do in  in delaware parks production of midsummer running through august 19 in buffalo ny. director kyle loconti though has loaded the lovers dice with physical comedy. the result is a great ensemble production where lovers are as likely as buffoons to elicit laughter. and the actors are not the only stars shelley hains elegant choreography of the fairies and katie menkes sound design which paints an aural rainforest both deserve special mention. the set and costumes evoking honduras in the 1920s provide a fresh take on this frequently produced play.  nathan elsener has designed the outdoor stage to look like castle walls draped with greenery and tropical flowers. when the action moves deeper into the rainforest the fairies insert parasols painted and reshaped to resemble huge flowers. costume designer dixon reynolds dresses the fairies in brilliant hues and garments inspired by the indigenous people of honduras. s and s headdresses are especially beautiful featuring multi colored spikes.  played by chad fess wears metal encrusted armbands and loincloth and his hair is shaved into a punk version of a mohawk. fesss delivery toys with the timing of the lines making you wonder whether  is really clever or just a beat or two behind his boss . the athenians meanwhile look like british colonizers with their khaki colored linens tall boots and jodhpurs.  jonathan shuey even wears a straw pith helmet turning his regal air a bit goofy. costumes and casting are especially helpful in distinguishing the petite  emily hin with her long dark curls and linen shift from the tall  mary ryan with short red hair and riding pants and boots. that the athenians are overdressed for the climate becomes quickly evident as the young lovers get all mixed up in the woods.  played with growing exasperation by geoff pictor as hes chased by the hopeful  loses one or more items of clothing every time we see him until he wears only his skivvies and garter equipped socks. and thats pretty much what all the lovers are down to when they have their hilarious and pivotal confrontation in the woods just before intermission. hin is especially good as she goes from bewildered to clingy   she jumps onto  a muscular kevin donohue and refuses to be peeled off him. then this diminutive  has to be restrained by both men when she tries to wallop .  the quartet plays this scene with dizzying twists and turns as each accuses the others or challenges a rival. by contrast the scenes with the local yokels who want to put on a play for the dukes nuptials seem almost placid. but theyre just as finely crafted building first to bottoms transformation into an ass and then to the performance of their play. jeff coyle as bottom the weaver is masterful. he nails the overreaching actor whose talent is no match for his ego. once  turns bottom into an ass coyle trots like a donkey swaying his behind with delicate grace. but his most sidesplitting bit is his prolonged dying scene as pyramus in which he manages to stab himself repeatedly slit his wrists spill forth his guts hamstring himself get riddled by machine gun bullets and succumb to what seems like consumption. james robert steiners meek flute meanwhile finds his shrill voice as the effeminate but not quite feminine thisbe. he adds his own death scene flourish throwing a curtsy into the middle of hisher demise by self inflicted stabbing. details like that add up to a delightful and rewarding night of open air theater.,4,Comedy,Positive
Midsummer Night's Dream,"A Dream with Lovers, Fairies, Mechanicals, and Audience",Eric Minton,bottom awake from his night of cavorting with a fairy queen in the athenian woods expounds on what he calls his most rare vision and determines that he will get   to write a prologue about his dream. and it will be called  rick blunt playing bottom says drawing out the line to see if he can get the audience to weigh in. bottoms dream a woman shouts from the stalls. blunt looks at her pretends to consider the notion and finishes his line as if he has come to a decision bottoms dream but then he steps toward the front of the stage and looks right at the woman. because it hath no bottom he says to her explaining to her the real reason for his decision. football teams have a twelfth man national league baseball teams have a tenth man and the actors of the american  center have an additional player the audience a twelfth player for the current eleven player asc touring troupe ending its travels with a two month residency at the blackfriars playhouse. the theaters configuration thrust stage audience sitting on gallant stools on stage and in the lords gallery above house lights kept lit and the companys adherence to original elizabethan theater practices including directly engaging the audience makes seeing any individual performance at the blackfriars a singular theatrical event. aside from the woman shouting bottoms dream the stars of this production include a little girl who giggles shyly when  speaks to her about romance the man whose face  strokes with her hands searching for  in the dark the other man whose foot becomes s pillow and the couple in the gallery who approve s plot. as  bellows his prologue to pyramus and thisbe the comic moment is made richer by  and  trained actors and the audience patron sitting next to them reacting with seemingly coordinated wincing. all asc productions use these conventions but dream is most ideally suited for the medium because of its tone and structure. consider that when the rude mechanicals stage pyramus and thisbe the noble couples meld into the actual audience to watch and comment on the players. the other half of the asc performance creed is to concentrate on s texts and interpose no concepts. with no sets and no electrical effects the only concept left up to the director is in the dress costume designer victoria depew gives the athenians elizabethan costumes the fairies exotically outfitted as east indian and  sports a leather clad huntress outfit and the movements. director kathleen powers emphasizes movement from  entering in a tableaux of fairies their dancing seeming to create a multi faceted being to the lovers concisely choreographed but yet rambunctious battle. michael amendola is a dervish as  swaying as he listens to  giddily reacting to the lovers quarrel and at the mornings dawn getting the audience to clap along while he performs an acrobatic romping dance just for the fun of it. such text centric  works especially well if you have actors steeped in speaking s verse a talent evident in this company. stephanie holladay earl makes  a most aggressive and obstinate yet loving foil to  played with authority by daniel abraham stevens. earl doubles as a bare midriffed hip sashaying  who could make most men spirits and even gods cower. no wonder  has to drug her to get her to acquiesce to his demands. in an unusual doubling of roles eugene douglas plays both  and snug tempestuously macho as the fairy king painfully shy and constantly emulating bottoms exaggerated poses and gestures as the joiner. ronald peet turns in a triple headed or more accurately quadruple headed performance as an arrogant  a confused  and a seriously self conscious flute. as thisbee flute seems to think that standing tiptoe is the way to play a lady and though he resists the role at first as bottom argues to take on thisbe peets flute takes the pyramus script and begins studying the lines he dedicates his all to playing it well. thus when he comes on stage and hears  say i hope she will be brief peets flute drops character and gives the warrior queen a withering look. asc tour troupe veteran rick blunt who gregariously glad hands the audience entering the playhouse before the play is born to play bottom and his bottom is born to play pyramus. blunt gives bottom a proud bearing and grand gestures and bottom gives pyramus the proudest of bearings the grandest of gestures including creating an o with his arms every time pyramus says o and the cruelest of deaths. it may be as hard to separate blunt from bottom as it is to separate bottom from pyramus but blunt is yet a student of the verse wringing fresh meanings in addition to big laughs from these 400 year old lines. answering s query of what he would desirest to eat blunts bottom turns to the luscious lady and in a creepily seductive mode replies i could munch your good dry oats. blunt seems to be a direct descendent of the original bottom will kemp not only speaking s lines as written but working the audience with those lines and expertly incorporating audience reactions into his lines. through the ascs productions we see that more than s words have remained relevant 400 years on his plays as originally staged still deliver enchanting entertainment and great fun for todays audiences.,5,Comedy,Positive
All's Well That Ends Well,Mirren and Palmer Shine but This Dream Lacks Magic,Vikki Jane Vile,today it is difficult to imagine a production in which robert lindsay helen mirren phil daniels and geoffrey palmer all the share the limelight however thirty years ago the bbc treated us to a production of arguably s most magical play with an equally spellbinding cast. educational online resource ambrose has recently added the entire collection of bbc  plays first released in the 1980s so at play.com we felt it would only be fitting to look back on these works to see how time has treated them and whether they are still accessible for a modern audience. this starry production of a midsummer nights dream is directed by elijah moshinsky and released in 1981. initially i was disappointed by the consistency with which the production was so darkly lit feeling it lacked imagination and the magical autumnal glow that is a vital part of the dream for me. thankfully the white bridal costuming worn by all the prominent females gives the production a much needed lightness. from the opening act i wanted to be entranced by an other worldliness but was instead faced with a rather staid and colourless backdrop of the athenian kingdom. sisters  and  cherith mellor and pippa guard respectively are equally unlikeable in this first act where the production craves the warmth that will thankfully be provided by palmer mirren and co. later on s ugly anger and frustration only serves to enhance her lack of beauty in comon to the fair  who despite her looks appears to lack any spirit of character at this early stage. quite why she is so in demand with  and  is hard to decipher at times. fortunately this production really takes off once transported to fairyland and the characters develop and the mystery and magic i had been craving. phil daniels plays a likeable  who the viewer grows to trust as the play progresses whilst at the same time making for an interesting fairycockney hybrid. he is spritely energetic and captures the essence of fairyland in contrast to the sedate and uninspiring atmosphere present in the athenian lifestyle. praise must be given to helen mirren whenever is it not? for her role as . she brings much needed softness and femininity to the role that is lacking so in  and  who at times are brash loud and unappealing. mirren on the other hand positively glows in her role as fairy queen. i found the moment where she falls in love with bottom disguised as an ass hilariously funny as she glows with the radiance of a woman truly in love in a way i have seen no other actress play the role. i believed every perfectly articulated word she spoke since she gives each word sufficient weight but also a fairy daintiness. the action in fairyland is interspersed with visits to the hapless group of labourers led capably by geoffrey palmer in the role of . they are an endearing bunch but i found most hilarity came from the idea of palmer playing a poor actor. their muddled performance of pyramus and thisbe is another highlight of the production as they entertain the guests at  wedding. the performance is everything a bad play should be ill rehearsed unbelievable and executed by the hopelessly incapable. the earlier glimpse into their rehearsal efforts also make the for an amusing scene. on reflection my harsh initial thoughts on this 1981 production of the dream were happily to be discounted for the sheer joy provided by the likes of mirren and palmer who can always be trusted to add colour and interest to what i still think to be a slightly unimaginative set up for what is one of s most magical plays. the dream has so much scope for creativity in the staging that this production comes off at times a little bland but is however saved by the mystery and magic of fairy land which captures the sense of liberation at the plays heart.,3,Comedy,Negative
Midsummer Night's Dream,Texan Feminists' Comic  Reversal of A Midsummer Night's Dream ,Michael Meigs,once a year a theatre production of the weird sisters collective briefly appears like a friendly comet in the evenings in austin texas.  like comets theyre wanderers at least in recent years    you need to be alert for news of them each july or august because  the venues for their productions have changed from year to year. they had planned to do the jacobean drama the roaring girl by dekker and middleton under the guidance of their friend dr. lizz ketterer but ketterers unexpected death in february left them adrift.  they turned to comfort theatre    s a midsummer nights dream one of those reliable pieces that as robert faires of the austin chronicle once commented comes around on austin stages with the regularity of clockwork. faires observation was accurate.  a midsummer nights dream is familiar and beloved for its airy fantasy and good hearted mockery of the predicaments of love.  we all enjoy white magic whether it involves transformation of brash tradesman bottom into an ass or transformation of love besotted young persons into fools.  plus its the shortest of s plays. the sisters flight to familiar fantasy received a sharp shock after work on it had begun.  the young attractive and promising actress senait fessahaye cast as  died suddenly.  fessahaye had appeared as the conjur woman invented by   carroll for his adaptation of poes the fall of the house of usher done by his weird city theatre company no direct relation to these weird sisters.  in  p. stites staging of early girl for his palindrome theatre she had played a vulnerable young woman brought up in a brothel.  she disappeared from austin and from this life as suddenly as any comet. despite the darkness of these circumstances the weird sisters bring their familiar irreverent attitude again to their theatre work.  women all and feminists of either    excuse me whatever sexual persuasion in their collaborative direction of the piece they choose to portray one of the love pairs fleeing to the woods as young women devoted to one another  smoothly and without the least incongruity becomes lysandra in the cheerily positive portray by hollie baker.  as always with them and in direct contradiction to an original practice mens roles are taken by female actors ably assisted by the indulgent audiences willingness to suspend disbelief. vicki yoder as boastful bottom the weaver is like money in the bank for this company a strong presence with a sense of fun fully absorbed in her character.  the real stand out however is the doyenne of this collective susan gayle todd.  aptly she is   the carpenter the captain of this imaginary company of rude mechanicals.  todd wrote last years script of sycorax a fully imagined account of the shadowy figure of the witch mother of monster caliban of the tempest. this   is a vigorous convincingly pot bellied texas rancher type with texas stride and texas twang earnestly limited and used to command.   parcels out the roles to the comical mechanicals keeps them encouraged and focused and all in all is a natural leader.  during the always amusing final act with the mechanicals reenactment of the tragical story of pyramus and thisbe  stands at the platform deep in center stage the very picture of any theatre director intently following an opening night performance and an opening night audience. part of the fun is seeing how the sisters send up the familiar figures of the story.  favorites for me are rachel briles as the emphatic frustrated  baffled by the sudden transformation of other suitors rae sen as an unexpectedly sombre  king of the fairies and co director christa french as queen of the fairies  with assurance and mastery of the rhythms of the text.  there are plenty of bit parts that sparkle however including all of the mechanicals. a slide show before the opening presents a mischievous twist of the tale to newly declared presidential candidate rick perry this states governor with chiseled features and good hair.  adroit mockups of newspapers and magazines projected at stage center suggest a back story for duke  including allegations that he was photographed with a male staff member at a nude beach.  the fakes are entertaining and the concept elicits a chuckle along with a suggested explanation of why the duke noelle fitzsimmons is so insistent on marrying an apparently less than enchanted  lauren schultz.  overall however gender bending in the sisters staging is largely irrelevant mortals will be fools regardless of their sexual orientation and were free to laugh at their follies and pretensions. their production at center stage on real street is literally a dark one with many of the upstage scenes taking place in shadows.  it appeared that this was due more to technical shortcomings than to directors intent.  center stage may simply not have had enough stage lighting instruments and controls to do the job.,3,Comedy,Negative
Midsummer Night's Dream,No More Yielding Than a Dream,Matthew Barbot,spare set costumes and lighting have long been staples of mountings of s plays ever since  first mounted them. ever wondered why characters often talk at length about what their surroundings look like or about offstage action? its not just because  thought it was pretty   the characters are actively painting a picture for the audience who has come to hear the play performed. perhaps none of the plays in s canon has so benefited fromsuffered frombeen affected by the advent of modern stagecraft and well modern glitter than a midsummer nights dream. the magic can be presented to us in the form of lighting sound cues makeup effects projections spandex ribbons and yes glitter. whether this has been a change for better or worse its often refreshing to see shows stripped down even a show so reliant on magic. folding chair classical theaters production of midsummer is just such a spare production the access theaters space is wide open with no exits or entrances and no lighting   the bulbs in the ceiling are all anyone gets. costuming is spare as actors appear in their pajamas adding pieces here and there from four coatracks that are sometimes used as setpieces. this is folding chairs ethos to see how evocative and clear [they] can be with just actors on a bare stage and to focus on plot character and language rather than on spectacle and socialpolitical agendas. director marcus geduld has certainly lived up to simplicity in his staging but the show may have benefited had stagecraft and any strong interpretation of the play itself not been replaced with a detrimental gimmick the role assignments change every night. each of the six actors involved in the show has rehearsed a number of roles and which roles they are to play for any given performance are drawn at random by audience members. the cast acquits itself well and while there are no weak links among the six there are standouts. andy kirtlands  was grounded and stately his  capable of a supernatural gravitas. justin gallo underwent the biggest transformations between characters his spritely energetic cartoony  contrasting his weary . again the cast is uniformly funny and engaging but theres not much more to say about their performances because honestly they dont seem to be the point. whats more ive only seen one possible iteration of the show and anything i write may not be applicable to readers who may see this show later. this production focuses on the novelty of getting through the whole play when no one knew for sure who they were going to interpret at the start that is to say the shows gimmick runs out before the show even begins and after that its just about successfully getting through the play which may as well have been any other play. the focus is on the fact that any actor could play any combination of any of the few characters theyve rehearsed and the consequence is that each of those characters is undeveloped broad and shallow. its possible that over the course of the run the actors will continue to find nuance in their favorite roles but even then its unlikely theyll find their characters the way an actor dedicated to definitely playing certain roles for every performance will over a shows rehearsal and run from that characters inner life to that characters interactions with other characters as interpreted by the other cast members. whats worst about the randomly assigned cast is that the only people who can actually fully appreciate it are the actors in the show unless the idea is for audience members to come back again and again the roles drawn from a hat thing may as well be a ruse. knowing the script the actors can have fun with their navigation around the difficulties of their double castings but it makes for unclear storytelling   when gallo has to jump between  and  i find it amusing because im a writer for play but the middle school aged girls seated in front of me fell into confused whispering. folding chairs mission statement does not preclude exploration of characters and themes and it would also seem to imply that what it deems unnecessary baggage should not be replaced with different baggage. granted the charming cast does seem to be having a blast but its not the best way for an audience to experience the play.,3,Comedy,Negative
Midsummer Night's Dream,No Recurring Dream,Matthew Barbot,usually when a critic says he felt like he was watching a different play its a negative. the cast or the director missed something vital a production concept or interpretation was fundamentally flawed the play was not the play. as i learned in my interview with him however director james rutherford would probably delight in such a comment. his stated goal was to try his best at every turn to ignore the production history and traditional trappings of a midsummer nights dream while working on his mounting   which took the stage at riverside theater january 26th 29th   to take the text at its word and not rely on the images we traditionally associate with the play. what emerges is sometimes funny but often frightening harrowing and deeply affecting. so here you go james i felt like i was watching a different play. and i loved most of it. most of it. rape is a strong choice for the very beginning of a play but we open with the slightly more than implied rape of  katie meister who doubles as  by  tom okeefe who doubles as . it immediately brings to mind both dramaturgical questions how does one rape an amazon warrior queen without completely incapacitating her and sustaining considerable injury oneself? and dramatic ones where do we go from here?. it makes us really dislike  and whats worse sets a tone right at the top of the show that is almost immediately abandoned. most of it. piehole the puppeteers and performers that worked with mr. rutherford created a piece of multimedia theater based on pyramus and thisbe that replaces the performance by   bottom and the rest. it is beautiful. i cant emphasize enough that it is a wonderful piece of theater on its own. nestled into a production of a different play however it is a jarring tonal and stylistic shift as well as overly long. most of it. the rude mechanicals are all skilled funny energetic and engaging especially patrick harrison as bottom. but for a production so dedicated to risk and re envisioning these were the exact same mechanicals we get in every other version of this play. there are worse sins than these i suppose and the rest of the production was so thoroughly engrossing that i often felt like i was hearing this play for the first time   the fresh approach to the text had me laughing from genuine surprise for example when  woke up in her bower to find bottom ass head newly fixed to his shoulders rather than mere recognition. the fairy world is dark but not in a way that seems forced   theirs is a world of immense power. there is real love and history in the relationship between  and  and so his jealousy and her devotion to her handmaiden are as apparent as the dull pain she feels at their estrangement. s interest in the mortals who enter his forest is borne not of mischief but from a real pity and concern for s plight.  jeremy pickard though athletic and often spritely as he is usually portrayed is also much more sinister after all the trouble he causes in the play isnt trivial he nearly ruins a womans life leaves a man to live the rest of his life bewitched and takes measures to ensure that s enchantment turns out as humiliating as possible by creating a monster and placing it in her path. the delight this  takes in watching mortals caught in a downward spiral bound by their weaknesses is more akin to an iago than a mischievous fairy. the fairies piehole created are built from household tools and so are sharp metallic imposing to mere mortals at first glance though ultimately harmless and eager to please. the magic of this midsummer is never cute and the consequences of the conflict distracting  and  from keeping things under control are not either. the differences in this production are naturally nowhere more apparent than in the lovers. their scenes though often funny are never played specifically for laughs. gone is the slapstick and broad caricature usually associated with the play replaced with a cast that is willing at every turn to take the script at its word. once again the relationships and characters are well drawn where so often the characters are nearly interchangeable.  nick dillenburg and  margaret odette have a fantastic rapport.  emily gleeson is clearly a young woman consumed with jealousy and a measure of self loathing and might even be a bit imbalanced because of it   her scenes with  show us a  that is desperate for approval and affection even to her own detriment. this is aided by a  federico rodriguez who doesnt throw away his threats of rape and murder as if he hopes the audience doesnt notice them. the scene where both men fall for  is triumphant because rutherford gives the characters all the credit of being real people with real emotions. far from the usual catfight and consequence free scuffle we see  not only losing the one she loves inexplicably but so totally that he claims to hate her   really hate her   and treats her accordingly.  begins the scene experiencing what she believes to be the worst kind of bullying but as the miraculous reality of the situation begins to dawn on her   that she has not only traded places with the object of her jealousy but surpassed her   she owns it completely gloating over her former friend and pulling no punches. i was literally on the edge of my seat. the somewhat uncomfortable laughter in the audience came from knowing that this was something we were supposed to laugh at right? and yet what was unfolding was not funny at all   amidst the beautiful visuals and gracefully choreographed stylized fighting four young people were hitting rock bottom just before the moment of their release. similarly the plays final moment after curtain call    in his wedding tuxedo purple love juice still staining his face staring dead eyed into the audience as his appointed love clings to his arm just a bit too adoringly   addresses the problem of s enchanted love of  where so many other productions merely ignore it. i have nothing against traditional productions of a midsummer nights dream   the play has a rich performance history is one of the bards more accessible works and is a crowd pleaser every time. and hey i love slapstick comedy as much as the next guy. james rutherfords production however serves as a reminder of the possibilities in producing . there is richness to be explored even in texts that are taken for granted a richness that does not require imposed concepts and contemporary updates to tackle. as rutherford demonstrates it is best to leave assumptions preconceptions and audience expectation at the door when approaching a work.  and  next please?

Midsummer Night's Dream,Dark Dream from the South Coast,Melissa Crismon,south coast repertorys a midsummer nights dream on the segerstrom stage veers from the light and whimsical to a mildly dark production.  rob campbell a mischievous laid back fairy speaks slowly and distinctly as he slinks toward the audience. campbell appears to be a melancholy servant to king  elijah alexander instructed to find the magical flower for  to use on queen  susannah schulman.  neither fairy is as exuberant as one might anticipate.  schulman is forthright with the fairies but  alexander and  schulman are somewhat awkward in their dance and kiss. a forest inspired by set designer cameron anderson allows the fairies to climb on the wall with a painted façade of the rings of a tree for a door. the façade opens for fairies commanding entrances and exits delighting the audience. through the entrance s whimsical bed is a small boat that suspends from above. a paper collage tree hovers over the stage constructed of white squares of paper that comes and goes with the sound of chimes. costume designer nephelie andonyadis creates dynamic entrances particularly for  as she enters with arms spread for all to adore her. her dress wows the audience as they aaaah. s coppery pink floor length shag skirt opens in the front with sea foam green tulle peeking out to reveal a mini skirt of pink tulle. a band of glittery copper on the waist and beaded bustier shimmer in the light of dripping light bulbs created by light designer lap chi chu. more tulle hangs from her wrists and jewels adorn her neck. s jacket is also revealing in the front which extends in the air circling his hips to the back. the material is stiff and resembles a beetle. though the costumes are dynamic they are not always figure flattering but that does not matter since everyone is down to his or her undergarments by the last act.  tobie windham takes off one of s red gloves and kisses her hand as though he never knew he found her previously appalling.  nick gabriel does the same with the other hand as to not be out matched.  dana green could easily be nettlesome as she chases  a non reciprocating lover. instead green is smart and funny with phrasing that allows the words to sound like todays language as she says it is not friendly.  and  kathleen early play up their height differences as green towers over early. early is a sweet  unaware of her surroundings. unbeknownst the fairies have taken off  and s clothes.   early nonchalantly walks and speaks as two fairies hold her dress over her head. in the heat of the argument  green responds have you no modesty? as she stands in lingerie. all the while king  elijah alexander and  rob campbell sit watching their doings while the rest of the fairies sit on the ledges of the wall. director  rucker incorporates dance by choreographer ken roht that is modern and jazz influenced. the fairies sing and dance a lullaby that lulls  to sleep in her suspended bed. roht and  ballingers collaborative pre recorded music has a jazzy feel that allows for some free style moves by the fairies. jaycob hunter a fairy dances with strength as he stands out among the group fairy dances. the direction explores the negative words of the royals allowing clumsy and awkward but not over the top funny workers.  adding a few dark fairies along with the clever mischievous ones keeps the worlds at odds with each other causing a sober midsummer. where there is comedy there is underlying raw truth.,4,Comedy,Positive
Midsummer Night's Dream,Tepid Midsummer Lacks Laughs,Michael Kostroff,one of the things i love about theatre is that it can happen almost anywhere. ive seen theatre spring up in church basements in the woods on street corners in living rooms even inside cars las the car plays. here in new york arguably theatres holy land one finds widespread evidence of this adaptability. and so i found myself this hot thursday night wending my way through a less traveled residential area of astoria queens to a non descript brownstone then heading down a flight of cement stairs that leads below street level following along the side of a building and finally emerging into a tiny backyard. its here that on the square productions offers its queens debut a midsummer nights dream. the idea of re purposing the space is somewhat more charming than the result. risers set up along the back of the building support three small rows of chairs with additional seating on the ground in front all told room for an audience of about thirty maybe forty tops. the garden framed with plants and flowers provides a decent enough playing space but for one glaring and insurmountable challenge just a few feet from down center a tree of respectable size obscures much of the upstage area. the set such as it is is no more than an angled lattice wall upstage a large papasan chair ringed in twigs bits of iron fence a bench two rope trellises and the existing flora. still one imagines scenic designer zane enloe turned slightly pale upon first seeing his stage with its dominant obstruction. but midsummer is a play that can overcome such obstacles provided it delivers whopping doses of whimsy mischief silliness magic and hilarious confusion. sadly these are the productions biggest shortcomings. for the most part this dream is plodding and joyless in spite of several good performances by professional accomplished actors. its the prevailing wisdom in theatre that unless youre a welles or a gielgud or a branagh directing and appearing in the same production is a mistake. most are urged to choose one or the other task either to be among the cast working on a role or to be outside watching and shepherding the production. its not quite a rule its more like a widely accepted guideline. but for some reason those who decide to exempt themselves are usually those least equipped for the dual task. they usually cast themselves in leading roles making it all the more difficult to maintain an outside eye. michael swartz who both directs and plays  unfortunately misses much of what makes the play and his role fun. a midsummer without fun? why bother? the tone for the evening is set with the appearance of reserved mysterious sad countenanced margaret stutt who playing two chords repeatedly on the accordion sits on a bench and sings inaudibly. later in the evening she looms on the sidelines accompanying her accordion by striking single notes on a xylophone never cracking a smile. her compositions indie pop in style dont quite mesh with s lyrics nor do they help convey meaning. these two problems an overly serious tone and a failure to squeeze sense out of the words are clouds that under swartzs direction hang over most of the evening. the cast has strengths and weaknesses. as the lovers caitlin kinsella  austin nixon  michael raver  and marnie schulenburg  make a good team. though more dramatic than comedic the mens performances are truthful and connected. the ladies who are funnier manage to score some of the laughs in the text to the great appreciation of the audience. schulenburg has moments of comical hysteria and kinsellas larger than life energy makes her fun to watch. as bottom zack calhoon is charming accessible ticklishly funny and conveys the text with the clarity his colleagues lack. particularly fun is calhoons zenned out bliss among the fairies. kane prestenbacks flute is low key but endearing. he then shines unpredictably as a wonderfully manic thisbe in the play within a play until the end when strangely his performance becomes moving dramatic and heartbreaking. the wrong choice excellently executed. fellow mechanicals branson reese snug and christine sanders snout slip into the trap of showing their comedic choices rather than possessing them sanders in fact seems to be in another play with a vaudeville level energy thats far too big for the intimate setting while colleen harris   and zoe sjogerman  are likeable but lacking in presence. rachel mcphees  is a delightful standout her every word and gesture alive and solidly engaged. shes ethereal grand sexy and silly everything a  should be. the characterization is a study in sensuality and arch intensity and mcphee lifts the tide whenever shes onstage. still with better direction more humor and less drama could have been mined as this production needs every ounce of available funny. swartzs  wears a gray tunic and such is the color of his performance. nowhere is the wild madcap forest sprite who revels in mischief delights in confusion and lives for mayhem. this character is like a grounded plane designed to fly but never approaching lift off. chris whites  is similarly froth free. hes intense and serious letting more comedic choices bluster petulance comedic frustration mischievous relish elude him. its clear he like most of his colleagues is a good actor. but these performances lack levity creating a tone that feels less like a frolic in the woods and more like a business meeting. lighting designer christopher shadow edwards does a marvelous job with his challenging environment using a combination of gelled work lights lit torches candles in glass orbs and tiny spots all cleverly hidden among the plants. costumes by aubrey hansen seem somewhat random and not particularly fun. modern day clothes appear to have been pulled from closets with little thought for coordination and costumes fashioned for  and  are drab and without detail though her maxfield parrish like dresses for the four supporting fairies work beautifully and her all white finale creates a refreshing stage picture. at the end of act one an offstage company member cued the audience by initiating applause one of the great faux pas in theatre if you have to cue the audience theres something wrong. conversely two of the evenings highlights both of which got organic responses were inadvertent ones the first was the unscheduled appearance of two neighborhood urchins who peered down from street level above watching the proceedings from their neighboring yard and trying to figure out what was going on. the second was the familiar sound of an ice cream truck making its tuneful way along a nearby street just before s line but who comes here? now thats light hearted fun.,2,Comedy,Negative
Midsummer Night's Dream,By and By: There Are No Lulls in SDSU's Dream,Melissa Crismon,lull lull lull a by lulla lull a by  a catchy tune is what youll naturally remember in this play transformed by san diego state universitys school of theatre into a 1960s inspired musical production of a midsummer nights dream. you remember the tune and the mischievous fairies singing harmonious melodies while dancing to a live rock band. director  larlhams production of midsummer draws inspiration from 1967 the beginning of the summer of love. its a time when teens rejected the lives their subordinate parents seemingly unconsciously chose for themselves. this allows cast and crew to be uninhibited in their acting and creativity. in order to draw out this theme the cast intently studied s words and particular lines. this attention to detail comes out in both articulation and phrasing making their take on the play easier to understand. the music is fun for the audience as well as the cast and crew. s lyrical words are set to the tunes of theatre major thomas hodges composed music from the years of 64 to 68. hodges created beat driven music and melodies that enhance the rock edge of  simone as  and gracie lee brown as  as well as the purity of michelle tymichs voice as moth. the chorus of fairies is influenced by the musical jesus christ superstar. band members thomas hodges on keyboard jon wat on bass  sherman on guitar and bradley sattler on drums have a great rapport in this newly formed band. set lighting and costume design all mesh with the summer of love theme. the stage is a forested green field made of putting green. in the back are hidden stairs that enable the cast to slink down the stairs disappearing into the horizon particularly effective when  and the fairies dance away. the inverted white umbrellas in the sky are lit in blues and greens adding to elizabeth ryans ethereal set design and michelle carons lighting. many of the costumes help develop the characters or help the actors get into character. costume designer valerie henderson dresses  in royal purple with material draping from her shoulder and tied to her wrist her hair in a lovely up do by hair and makeup designer sara zuniga.  sherman as  has a  lennonsergeant pepper style in a military jacket round glasses and bobbed hair adding to the tantalizing costume design. many of the actors stand out for their unique strengths in their delivery physicality and singing. the lovers are appropriately comedic and confusing at the same time. fernando huerto as  and david armstrong as  cannot walk off the stage without body slamming each other arguing over  to the point of slapstick. as armstrong tries to run away from amanda dasteel as  he trips and rolls down the steps reminiscent of a  ritter move in threes company. dasteel just as humorous portrays a desperate  as she holds onto armstrongs leg. huerto as  delivers his love of  tenderly but is equally convincing when the flower juice changes loves direction toward . davenport as a sweet spoken  surprises the audience as she tries to fight dasteel while huerto and armstrong break things up.  smith a tall and rangy  holds back nothing as he literally jumps into the air exuberantly narrating and singing. there are airs of  frampton here maybe its the visually stimulating fringe vest that opens to a peace sign painted on his chest. maybe its the frizzy blond hair that screams of some 1971 rock musical depicting a 1960s icon. dressed as a hippy smith sings an entertaining duet with the dreadlocked  simone as  adding excitement to the production. simones tonal quality is easy on the ears while he commands the stage with ease. simone sings a duet with gracie lee brown as  whose commanding voice is as widespread as her arms. in a cast of perfect pairings derek smith as pyramus and nathan bell as thisby throw the audience into fits of laughter. the mechanicals are in a play within a play that reads like a  and  spoof. bell as thisby sports fake breasts a dress a shawl and work boots. his fake kiss with smith occurs through a human wall with cereal boxes draped from his arms to look like bricks. smiths recurring death scene inspires laughter both onstage and off leading to bells own death scene during which he takes pyramus sword and pierces his fake breast while speaking in an ascending shrill of undetectable words. this sends the audience into hysterics. a midsummer nights dream recovers equilibrium in the end.  promises us jack shall have jill naught shall go ill. whether you trust him or naught sdsus midsummer is a dream you can believe in. a midsummer nights dream runs april 30   may 8 2010 at the san diego state university school of theatre don powell theatre 5500 campanile dr. san diego ca 92182. information can be found at httptheatre.sdsu.edu.,4,Comedy,Positive
Midsummer Night's Dream,Dialing in a 1960s Texas Night's Dream in Austin,Michael Meigs,this is  for a summery texas evening in austins zilker park. the wide and gentle slope above the hillside theatre is the perfect place to sprawl out on a blanket as the stars come out the players play the music sounds and the action flits before you. a midsummer nights dream is a favorite in part because it is sweet and not particularly demanding.  runs masques with the dukes court with the fairy court with the clownish tradesmen and with the ever so earnest and therefore inevitably comic young lovers. add a few portions of fairy juice feature  for mischief and transform the braggart clown into an ass whats not to like? ann ciccolella enlisted st. edwards university polymusicalist michael mckelvey to do up midsummer with 1960s style music. this offers an austiny bit of odd retro flair kind of like those 1960s rock shows that the popular and long established zach theatre keeps putting on year after year. why the 1960s? thats not really clear. the company is doing a midsummer nights dream without much effort to reflect any of the summers of peace and love. music by mckelvey and co composerlead guitarist cesar osorio generally consists of interval pieces. most of the musical punctuations drop into the action as if dialed up on a car radio. the cleverest bits are the cheery whistling theme music of the rude mechanicals and the thrumming accompaniment for the fairies dance played while clearing the forest for the final scenes. does anyone need a recap? dramaturg cristina gutierrez from the university of texas provides an erudite page of commentary in the program and another of glossary just in case you want to go all scholarly on a lazy evening. jennifer madisons fairy costumes are fun but i was a bit disconcerted to see duke  wearing a marine uniform without insignia. the young lovers are properly foolish and appropriately cast clad and played to look as if they are teens in need of a few more years to figure themselves out. director ann ciccolella re jiggered the professions of the lively and amusing rude mechanicals including among them a postman a plumber and a waitress on roller skates. with madisons campy costumes the group struck me as somehow strangely familiar. it wasnt until the big dance preceding the finale when they came on doing a concentrated high stepping dance line that i got it the village people right? or not?  aaron bells set is minimalist offering a bower stage left for s snooze but otherwise chiefly consisting of scrims and curtains lit evocatively by austins master lighting designer jason amato. ciccolella and austin  recruited capable talent for midsummer. gwen kelso and jenny larson as  and  are familiar favorites. michael dalmon as nick bottom is a revelation antic comic and well spoken even if he does choose to use a jed clampett voice when playing an ass.  moses is a thoughtful yet playful . macey mayfield has a tiny role as moth but she has lots of stage presence and a fetching twirl.  matthews is eye catching as   looking very young austin and erin molson plays both the roller skating robin  and moonshine.  lahay as francis flute overcomes the initial mailman costume showing his bony knees to become a credibly comic anguished thisby. theres no admission charge so youre getting a whole lot more than you pay for. when the actors come around at intermission be generous. these folks are fooling but they arent lying austin  needs and really appreciates everything you drop in the bucket. my advice forget the small change and give them some folding money. midsummer may be  lite but this production presents an attractive magical world for your evening in the park.,3,Comedy,Negative
Midsummer Night's Dream,Off Center Midsummer Takes the Stage,Michael Meigs,despite their name chaotic theatre this production of a midsummer nights dream is not chaotic at all rather its a straight up by the rules staging of s most popular comedy. this doesnt mean that its tidy or even. director michael floyd and the chaotic theatre band have some assorted neat ideas but little vision to tie them together. two guitars a drum and a female singer who is part of a combo named 11 cent confidence provide music before the show during intermission and intermittently throughout. they look and play like a standard austin garage band camping out solemnly deep stage right as the play proceeds. for some unexplained reason the stage is dressed with mounds of garbage left and right. some in the company are very good while others are barely in control of their speech and movement.  black is particularly accomplished at creating the hammy self importance of bottom the weaver ass and actor. blacks minimalist framework donkey headdress a magical piece of costuming is credited to costume designers cassie padgett and tara bland. black  matthews as  and grace lubeck as the fair  are all energetic alert well spoken and vested in the action attracting our eyes and our sympathy whenever they appear on stage. the redheaded franc freye as  is almost as good as his rival. but compare the very different moments when freye and matthews awaken with potion annointed eyes for the woebegone  freye seems groggy and hypnotized while matthews in his turn is visibly dumbstruck and literally enchanted by the sight of her. jane kilgore as the put upon  is suitably bewildered. she has her lines down pat but at times seems uncertain about just what to do with her hands or where to look. whether by decision or omission director michael floyd appears not to have defined any sort of relationship between actors and audience. in this production soliloquies generally empty into the air with actors eyes directed about two feet above the heads of the audience. a similar awkwardness occurs when the rude mechanicals put on their play within the play during the final act. its a wonderful opportunity to play to the crowd but here the actors suspend animation when the court folk behind them make their commentaries. caleb perkins as  steals every scene. hes athletic preening impossibly balletic and ever in motion pouting posturing and flaming. his loquacity and undulation make kevin frances  look and sound like a good hearted farm boy. elizabeth cooper as  and kara juarez jones as  are similar in appearance and mannerisms probably by coincidence rather than by design. some deftly realized cameos traci koesis as snug the joiner lion extempore with roaring is bright eyed and adorable elexia lowe as  has got some annoyed vampirella in her just the sharp tonic needed for that sugary fairy world. this is an agreeable exercise in community theatre the community encompassing some seasoned players some naturals and some tyros. it so happens that the proprietors of this garage like space off center are austins innovative collegial band of artists aptly named the rude mechanicals currently participating in the humana festival of new american plays in louisville kentucky. while the rudes are away the mechanicals will play enjoying exercising and polishing their craft. ,3,Comedy,Negative
Midsummer Night's Dream,A Forest Translated into an Industrial Dream,Deirdre Yee, stepping out of the subway station theatergoers arrive in south boston and trek past wide empty parking lots and vast rows of warehouses. the view is marred by a heavy snowfall and gusting winds. a short walk across this barren powder covered terrain brings us to actors  projects mid winter midsummer nights dream a delightful collaboration of dramatic and visual work between the boston arts academy and artists for humanity. the production opens in the two story dramatic space in midway studios tucked into a block of warehouses. amidst the urban setting the set and costume design artfully frames this industrial production. director benjamin evetts traditional dialogue and sparse cutting melds well with the modern setting to create a rich and accessible play. in a midsummer nights dream the excitement humor and visual splendor increase twentyfold when the lovers leave athens to stomp around the fairy realm. this production is no exception to rule in fact evett emphasizes the appeal of this gritty subculture by contrasting it with a dull and colorless athens. things get off to a slow start and a number of the actors in the first scene seem to struggle with s language. athenian love scenes fall flat while passionate declarations of love and adoration seem laughable and sickly sweet. jennie israel as  provides some relief from the syrupy dialogue as she bitterly stomps around rolling her eyes at lovebirds  mara sidmore and  shelley bolman. flourishing in woe dayenne byron walters as  simmers with a fathers rage while s pink cheeks color her desperation and add some passion to the sappy happiness of love. the set designed by graffiti artist rob gibbs problack with assistance from the artists for humanity graffiti team are exciting and innovative. this play traditionally planted in a wild forest is instead surrounded by a barren urban landscape of trash graffiti and wrecked cars. as night falls  maurice emmanuel parent rushes around to unearthly music tearing white sheets off set pieces to reveal the grimy underbelly beyond the sterile city. an iron industrial door sporting a spray painted moon and a two story tall painting of a tree dominate the set design.  the tree consisting of an industrial trunk jointed with branches that hold wispy foliage in a claw mirrors the mood of the nighttime scenes in the production. with industrial standing in for nature this urban landscape is tenuously threatening and bizarrely beautiful. emerging from this grimy backdrop are s fairies four students from boston arts academy whose ripped clothes skullcaps and attitudes challenge s . again incorporating the art of dichotomy the quiet fairies wear loud costumes that proclaim their rebellious anarchist natures. goth accessories are magical in their own right when they are slipped on the lovers they prove transformative with hilarious results. this magical world of the forest is a colorful battle between two street gangs in which the youthful fairies exude power over the well dressed adult lovers who stumble across their paths. s young manipulative and mostly mute apprentices circle menacingly whenever onstage and the fairies shrill lullaby is just plain creepy. maurice emmanuel parent plays an hilarious and daunting  decked in motorcycle studs and a mohawk. parents eyes reveal his wild and unpredictable nature that in glee distress or determination is always something a little beyond human. michael kaye is a gothic  sporting a long black coat spiky hair and the conniving authority that precedes the lovers mishaps.  nna bassham matches her estranged lover and beneath her pink hair basshams face is constantly tattooed with running tears of mascara. bassham is entrancing and she is one of the true stars of the show. she delivers her passionate speech about the changeling child in a miserable monotone voice that leaves the audience hanging on every word. when she pairs up with bottom robert walsh the production reaches its peak as these two amazing actors play off one another. walsh is a standout bringing the audience to their knees as he parades around playing a perfectly terrible actor with an ego that fills the stage. the mechanicals are a ragtag group of actors parodying acting troupes with a fantastic tongue in cheek attitude.   played by founding company member  kuntz is especially ridiculous as a sycophantic troupe leader lavishing attention on bottom while simultaneously sipping on starbucks coffee. the mechanicals are modern day goons employing slapstick into their production at the close of the play incorporating yoga stances and the longest death throes this reviewer has ever laughed through. nelson martinez jr. another baa student is a hilariously terrified snug an eager yet nervous mechanical who looks like he nearly succumbs to his fears when performing before the duke and duchess on their wedding day at night. the lovers plunders throughout the night reach a fever pitch that nearly escalates to a barroom brawl each influenced by the fairies around them.  christopher james webb dark eyed glare and harsh guttural denouncements in athens contrast sharply with the dancing love struck man about the forest clad in a leopard print jacket. s corny proclamations of love in athens transform into shouting whiny solicitations.  and s catfight is a sidesplitting primal version of the rivalry they only passive aggressively address in athens. the production ends with all the athenians coming together with the magical residents of the wood in a well coordinated dance and song conclusion that melds these two worlds into one. wild gleeful and risqué once this cast finds its stride this production embraces the best parts of their manufactured wilderness. ,4,Comedy,Positive
Midsummer Night's Dream,"Magical, Musical Midsummer with Glee",Denise Battista,cal shakes rounds their 2009 season with a midsummer nights dream coproduced by two river theater company in red bank new jersey. two rivers artistic director aaron posner directs this mostly gleeful yet sometimes dark production with an inventive eye bringing much music and chorus like narration to this dreamy comedy. fresh faces share the cal shakes stage with the tried and true and most of the newbies work. in fact most of this production works and what doesnt quite make the cut is still sharp with intrigue. patterns and shades of blue in a towering backdrop flow into the stage and down the stairs leading to the audience. the flat design oddly creates depth on this otherwise sparse stage that eventually offers doors grows ladders that act as trees and cradles oversized pillows on which the mixed up lovers sleep and fight.  perhaps the most mesmerizing part of brian sidney bembridges set design is the full moon looming above.  wests lighting design that casts imposing shadows around the theatre throughout the production also casts a heavenly reflection of sorts of this moon in the clear night sky above bruns amphitheatre somehow emphasizing the starry sky above creating an open universe for this play and a brilliantly lucid dream as our eyes are drawn upward. this magical feeling is further emphasized by the transcendent and melodious howling of doug haras  who seems to have some otherworldly connection to the moon and the skies above.  perhaps reaching here but  is the name of one of moons of uranus the planet named after the ancient greek deity of the sky. of the planets twenty seven known moons twenty four have names from s plays such as miranda ariel  and  and of course theres . both of these s wrap a girdle round its globe at night and both are mysterious entities. haras spry  works without a doubt. this hobgoblin grasps his pre elizabethan roots planted in somewhat devilish ground. with wests lighting this  looks downright sinister and when left to his own devices one gets the feeling that this sweet hobgoblin is capable of much more than breaking the legs on your stool. while  is usually seen as a sidekick for a more powerful  newcomer keith randolph smith errs on the side of over the top sitcom comedy. while he looks the part of forest royalty smith is rather whiny absurd when he jumps up and down in laughter garbled when he roars his lines and too excited in a childlike way  for the reserve of the fairy king. even if smith is trying to portray the absurdity of jealousy he comes across as being more jealous of the absurd. he also seems an incapable match for his  played by pegge son. son plays a strong queen in fact all the women in this production embrace strong characters. she and smith look oddly alike as the fairy queen and king with shaved heads and earrings and similar dress hardly androgynous but similar. even  has a shaved head. these are the only three spirits portrayed in this production. scenes with   and the others are left out or portrayed by haras narration or by a somewhat confusing but visually intriguing spritely red light in the hands of . the lovers are all very different which eliminates any notion that love is blind. erin weaver as  is a tough little scrapper with a solid right hook. she usually looks like shes ready to rumble with a masculine stance and center ring bounce in her step but weaver shows her soft side in a beautifully sung duet with her . avery monsen is charming and gallant handsome and romantic as  even when he takes a sock in the nose from his little vixen. richard thieriot is less obvious as  though its tough to forget a guy who enters the stage zipper down.  portrayed by lindsey gates is fabulously funny adding her own little asides winces and cries throughout the play giving her character its own habitation and name. fight director dave maier and choreographer erika chong shuch along with wests inventive lighting design work together to create exciting fight scenes and slow motion chaos between lovers and lunatics alike. and then there are the mechanicals led by none other than cal shakes crowd pleasing comedian danny scheie as bottom. although their original seated circle formation on stage while casting their play within the play is awkward what audience wants to look at the backs of actors when they could so easily enjoy their fronts the rest of their antics are well received with due laughter. scheie needs no props and no kicks to ooze comedy. his timing is impeccable and his ability to slightly contort his body or distort his gaze makes this gay and bully bottom tops. scheie steals the stage every time. ted barker  dan hiatt snout joan mankin snug patty gallagher  and lance gardner flute play the rest of scheies posse with their oncoming comedy erupting in the end with their take on ovids tragic tale of pyramus and thisby. gallagher might be the most enthusiastic  ever doing everything shy of pulling a molly shannon saturday night live breaking into a cheerleader pose and smelling her armpits in order to direct a successful show for  and s wedding day at night.  hiatt turns the role of wall into a laidback musical exposé complete with cockney accent scheie and gardner turn this tragic love story into a real lust affair as pyramus and thisby mankin plays a lion that apparently escaped from an insane asylum in fact mankin is frighteningly funny throughout whether as an unstable lion or an eruptive joiner and together these mechanical work. utterly hysterical. music and sound are big parts of this production be it haras music of the spheres or his echoes into the night the battle of the microphone at the plays start the musical adventures of the mechanicals with hiatts snout on guitar the playful strums accompanying a harmonious duet between  and  singing smokey robinsons youve really got a hold on me or the always exciting compositions of sound designer andre pluess.  im eternally touched when pluess includes his simple and simply perfect signature piano chord in the midst of exciting composition here adding a pristine chime whenever magic occurs in the play. and i cant help but believe he and posner were influenced by the hit television show glee when bringing this show to an end with an exhilarating exciting and well choreographed bergamask. an entire production of midsummer in this vein would work well with this creative team of players at the helm. a gajics costume design is sort of all over the place with some punky layers on  patterned chaos on  a bit of madmen some dick tracy some everyday casual garb and some elegant gowns. in a way i suppose you can say everyone has a style much like one would see in any ol crowd less the harnessed rack worn by thisbe in rehearsal their loosely elizabethan play or gajics brilliant nightmare of a donkey head. the lack of cohesion serves to place this play in any ol time and any ol place rather than confined to ancient greece or elizabethan england or 1980s middle america or or  and this is important for a midsummer nights dream especially when focusing on the universal themes of love falling in and out on jealousy on the concept of time and then of course on the arbitrary nature of it all. this production of midsummer speeds up time emphasizing warriors conquering then wooing to wed their wives or lovers falling in and out of love in the blink of a tainted eye all wrapped up in a fairy forged tornado of jealousy. this speed is best sped by portraying  as not only a shrewd and knavish sprite but as this productions greek chorus commenting on this plays themes and activities both on and off the stage in order to catch us up to speed.  its a little confusing as the events of the play seem to fall out of order sometimes when hara rhythmically delivers his summaries but its also interesting to hear  tell us in his own words what hes done to bottom in this  play turn adaptation. the twists and turns posner adopts mostly work. those that dont quite are still intriguing ideas. perhaps revisiting this play in the future perhaps in the vein of a musical is on posners inventive palate. if so this current production at cal shakes is one hell of a fun prologue.,4,Comedy,Positive
Midsummer Night's Dream,Well Met By Disco's Light:  The Donkey Show,Deirdre Yee,upon entering  the american repertory theatres theatrical club space we quickly meet its namesake the ringmaster of the drugs sex and madness who sends the rest of the cast spiraling and gyrating out of control in the donkey show. mr.  is center ring controlling everything in this disco dancing adaptation of a midsummer nights dream a sort of studio 54 meets the circus. the audience halts mid drink or dance step to gasp in awe at the impressive choreography acrobatics and ribbon dancing performed all around. glitter and sequins dominate the décor costumes and even the air in the club everywhere you turn theres more glam for gawking. tytanias fabulous fairy quartet of sexy male dancers is clad only in sequined hot pants glitter and makeup. they mount the stage the bar even the audience members that they pull up to share the dance platforms. the dj like the bouncers dons an open chest gold chains and yellow tinted sunglasses and blasts play that funky music as helen chases dimitri played by lucille  across the dance floor. mr.  gets friendly with the ladies in the crowd and the pursed lipped tytania looks on. the donkey show directed by diane paulus and randy weiner weiner also conceived this baby offers an immensely entertaining night of music dancing singing and acrobatics all wrapped up in a well choreographed bundle of joy. there are but few lines in this very physical production and each bit of dialogue quickly leads into a tightly choreographed song and dance routine that often delves into slapstick. original 70s music blares and the performers sing along whenever their passion draws them to it. its an interesting divergence from a typical musical but it works very well once we pick up our pace to meet the actors. heather gordon as mia shines as she tries to woo back her sander rebecca whitehurst with a bit a karaoke revealing frilly panties while drunkenly butchering a song a bottle in each fist. erin mcshane as helen is hilarious and uses physical comedy as she plays out the role of the unrequited lover. when standard practices of dedicating songs and seductively offering cherries out of her drink do nothing to spark interest in her dimitri mcshane wails out her case through thelma houstons dont leave me this way and we cringing with laughter cheer her on. scotty morgan is this productions  here called dr. wheelgood. morgan brings to mind the dark side of this debauchery as he tempts dancers into his glowing disco room for a snort or two of fairy dust before sending them on their randy way. there is something sinister and magnetic about his silent mischief and his agile roller acrobatics as he mutely enjoys the havoc he creates. the same sense of impressed wonder and wariness we offer dr. wheelgood accompanies every sensual move of tytania played by rebecca whitehurst. tytanias costume which consists of butterfly pasties knee high boots and blue hot pants that match her fairies leaves little to the imagination yet makes her all the more mysterious and untouchable. the creative team consisting of scott pask for scenic design david c. woolard for costume design evan morris on lighting and david remedios on sound deserves shared applause for an overwhelming audio and visual experience. eumir deodato performs richard strauss orchestral piece also sprach zarathustra giving each drugged transformation the otherworldly sensation of 2001 a space odyssey also calling to mind  sellers in being there. perhaps slightly out of tune are the vinnies who share the role of bottom. its here the magic of the production slightly subsides. though their braying is uproarious it seems the quick costume change works against the vinnies and the necessary suspension of disbelief is not quite enough to make this crouching pair seem like a donkey. aside from dr. wheelgood and the fairy escorts all the main roles are played by women which accentuates the parody of their super sexualized male characters. paulus and weiner offer some hilarious dance club adaptations of s themes. the vinnies for example are lower class rude mechanicals but are really no more rude than the other human characters. they do however interrupt their own song with gruff homophobic comments. dr. wheelgoods remedy for the lovers confused affections looks suspiciously like giant roofies. and tytanias love for an ass takes on a hilarious if not cringe worthy literal turn. the donkey show invites you into a fantastic taboo free wonderland. the audience is so enthralled they add their own soundtrack of cheering and catcalling to the production. this show thrives on taking obscenity far very far and with every cheeky nipple flash every arm lick and every dare i say crotch dive the audience only demands more. and this production complies beyond all measure but youll have to go to find out why this extravaganza is called the donkey show. the donkey show runs through october 31 2009 at the american repertory theater 2 arrow street cambridge ma 02138. tickets are 25   49. reservations and information can be found at

Midsummer Night's Dream,Midsummer in Santa Cruz a Back Flipping Good Time,Denise Battista,a midsummer nights dream is one of the most performed and thus well known of s thirty seven or so plays. herein lies the challenge. how does one create a production of midsummer thats worth talking about without adding too much jargon to its plotline?  santa cruz offers an updated athens complete with fashion vixens and victims cell phone interruptions gps directions and a duke who jogs with his secret servicemen. the mechanicals work like a well oiled machine and although they dont always stand upon point when delivering their hysterical version of pyramus and thisby these actors are spot on in their comedic timing. the athenian wood is ordered by the chaos of nature and by a larger than life king and queen of the fairies that carry an erotically tribal element. these spirits dance fairy rounds like youve never seen their costume makeup and hair design is brilliant and otherworldly and this shows  is exciting energetic and does back flips around other hobgoblins of the same name. thankfully none of this comes off as jargon. thankfully this is one dream of a midsummer thatll get you talking. director e. t. white offers many interesting angles for contemplation with an overriding focus on antitheses. theres the opposition of orderly athens versus the disorderly woods theres the beast in the man and woman and the man in the beast love and hate love and lust and an interesting opposition between mortals immortals children and adults between nature and humanity and the relationship between cause and effect. all of these things must somehow reconcile or at least achieve a state of acceptance before this comedy can come to a concordant end. the stage is set in the midst of the redwoods at sinsheimer stanley festival glen and the location couldnt be anymore idyllic for midsummer mischief. the players stay true to  santa cruz form and run rampant over the entire glen up and down over hill over dale in the trees and through the audience in effect offering the sensation that we too are deep in the athenian wood. michael ganios shoots and ladders set design is built in the guise of scaffolding and offers the fairies a place to linger when eavesdropping on the mortals and a place for the mechanicals to eat their lunches and cat call as the lovers make moan at the beginning of the play. its functional and fun a sounding board for the mechanicals hard handed orchestral introduction and above all it offers j. todd s  his own personal playground. this production is cast with beautiful people and scene stealers but the biggest thief of all is . when not charming the audience or lifting garb from the lovers s somersaults back flips scales walls and trees and leaps around the glen never slowing for a moment. he even wraps an exciting girdle round the forest glen in a magical disappear and reappearance act positioning this  in two places at once. tommy kearney boris volkov and zarif kabier sadiqi as crow bluejay and screech owl present the rest of s fairy followers but rather than speaking their support they trump this shows questionable audio design and offer their opinions as their respective birds would providing elemental sound effects in the woods and eerily lurking above the action. while s female fairy flock is visibly perturbed by s bottom dwelling b. moderns exquisite costume design of shapely corsets and brilliant flowers coupled with jakey hicks amazing hair and makeup create a beautiful and contrasting canvas between the two fairy camps. while daniel duque estrada  and elizabeth yoakem  are the power couple in athens aldo billingslea and lanise antoine shelley are two forceful powers to be reckoned with in the wood. this king and queen of the fairies wear their royalty well. they are passionate although their passion works better when they are separated versus together onstage especially in not quite perfectly danced numbers choreographed by patty gallagher during with the couple cant seem to get into sync. billingslea is also directed to engage in a couple of karaoke moments but his sing along is hindered by incessantly poor audio crackling in and out over the loud speakers. this is nothing that cant be fixed perhaps they could put one of the mechanicals on the job but it must be fixed if  is to gain any serious street cred in this forest. shelleys  is sensual fierce and exotic. e. t. white also makes a point to showcase her monologue about the seasons and the affect of earthly discord on natures harmony offering a subtle lesson moral intact. the young lovers are wonderfully youthful and full of angst. they present one guise in front of adults and another altogether when left to their own devices. lenne klingaman as  is adorable snotty and spoiled clenches a copy of stephanie meyers vampire novel about teenage sexual tension and alienation as though it was her personal bible. shes a rebellious teen who stomps and cs her arms when she doesnt get her way with her father yet immediately loses her modest cardigan when daddy exits the scene. klingaman and miles villanueva  have excellent chemistry so good that i dont think even a love potion could keep them apart for long. villanueva plays the casual rebel in front of  matt gottlieb but proves the poetic and gentle lover with . evans eden jarnefeldt is also full of contradictions sporting his sweater vest suit tie and boat shoes but looks can be deceiving as this clean cut youth plays violently in the woods. for the first time i was happy  remained under the love spell as it actually made him a nicer sort of bloke  played brilliantly by emily kitchens is a mortal of a different sort. at first she comes off as clingy and needy and wears a silly wide eyed smile on her face that makes one want to slap it off. this irritating little glitch soon becomes interesting however as we realize this tall somewhat gawky and scorned lover in gypsy layers and cowboy boots is actually a little nutty and if not for s magical intercession should probably have gone into therapy for being a hitter. i know it sounds terrible but kitchens is fabulous as a borderline undiagnosed train wreck. s biggest competition for show stealer is scott wentworth who plays one heck of a bully bottom. wentworth is a dramatic lovable charmingly pompous diva. he takes the range of his voice from top to bottom wears yarn tassels of beards on his belt and counts the number of lines in his script. he also loves to strike a pose and with every pose he allows just enough time for a laugh before moving on to the next perfectly timed moment. jonathan david visser as flute and as the most disturbing thisby to grace the an stage does a bit of show stealing of his own. when wall chris butler gives visser a wedgie visser gains the voice of mad tvs stuart larkin and as thisby he is obscenely funny to the point of needing to look away for fear your eyes may go blind with laughter. the rest of the mechanicals are just as endearing and the play within the play takes on a life of its own. yes this midsummer is surely something to talk about. a final shout must go out to the hidden falls girl scout troupe who on this particular day created their own peanut gallery in the audience stage left gaining the attention of the actors as they responded to some of the plays silliest and most well known lines. as a former girl scout i offer props to these girls who were girl scout prepared for this show. as a an i offer mad props as these girls are preparing to perform their own production of midsummer tucked in the hidden falls redwoods. break a leg ladies. i cant think of a better way to be prepared than to take note of  santa

Midsummer Night's Dream,A Mixed-Summer Night's Dream,Michael Kostroff, a midsummer nights dream is a play in which two very different worlds crash into each other the seen intersects with the unseen the mortal with the magical and in the case of the current production at will geers theatricum botanicum the intelligible with the unintelligible and the simply brilliant with the simply strange. the production opens with the loud and lively entrance of    and some people  calls others. its a boisterous group but were not quite sure what theyre on about. adding to the confusion some members of the party are inexplicably dressed like extras from the flintstones. if you havent seen the play in a while best of luck. for all the hoopla no one seems to be communicating his or her text very well. enter the lovers and not a moment too soon. these fine performers get the show beautifully and charmingly back on track and we all relax a bit. next come   and the band of laborers commonly called the mechanicals and hallelujah for them. as they entertainingly stumble all over each other every line makes sense and every comedic choice makes you giggle like an idiot. they earn exit applause after their first scene. then we meet the fairies who come skulking about the stage legs bent and heads cocked like the 58th touring company of cats. they wear face paint and outlandish costumes consisting mostly of leggings and ragged bits of polyester presumably to indicate that they are forest denizens. as they ooze about their arms float before them presumably to indicate that theyre magical or poised for an important karate match. they put great effort into speaking in strange disjointed tones with single words or phrases delivered as high pitched screams low rumbling growls or long drawn out notes presumably to indicate that theyre very interesting and have their own language. instead all the vocal gymnastics combined with all the modern dance like oozing crawling and gesturing serve only to obliterate all sense of meaning from the text leaving one straining to follow along. its at this point that you might experience the oh no  moment. thats when youre sitting at a play minding your own business and you suddenly start noting those early warning signs that lead you to suspect there may be cause for concern over how youll spend the next few hours. such is the oddly sandwich like make up of this production which is by turns enchanting confusing hilarious and annoying. lets focus on the positives. matt ducatis  is a reasonable man trying to conduct sensible conversations with crazy people. his albert brooks ish frustration is fun to watch particularly when hes desperately trying to extract  from his life. as  meredith sweeney displays substantial comic gifts playing first the entitlement of the popular girl accustomed to male attention and later the shock and insult of being dumped not once but twice in one crazy night. ira heinichens  isnt the shiniest performance but hes crystal clear both aurally and behaviorally which in this production is welcome relief. heinichen more than holds his own among some great comic actors. when willow geer takes stage as  you know youre in for a treat. she performs  so honestly and accessibly and with such comedic intelligence as to make everyone in the theatre an instant friend. her desperation and deliciously overblown whining evokes happy memories of lucy begging ricky to put her in the show. geer is a riot and elevates the performance of each actor with whom she exchanges dialogue. earnestine phillips is just terrific as thick headed leading the even thicker headed   the confused director of the ad hoc theatrical troupe rehearsing an awful play to present before the duke. her motley cast of sad sack players is portrayed by a wonderful group of actors. david marmors flute is marvelously awful as thisbe. jim thoms  has a subtle lost quality that makes you chuckle. understudy savannah southern smith fits right in with her comically awkward snug who later plays an utterly pathetic lion. kelly hentons snout is a hoot as he uncomfortably executes the role of wall. keep your eye on him as hes forced to stand there while others around him emote. its a smorgasbord. and as bottom thad geer simply decimates the audience reducing them to helpless puddles of laughter as he squeezes every drop of funny out of one of s funniest characters. its a divinely hammy over the top performance and one of the shows highlights. also in the one to watch department  zimmer is every bit as good in the smaller role of  as are others in larger roles. his witty delivery adds even more 11th hour laughs to the plays final sequence. elizabeth tobias aaron hendry and abby craden as respectively   and  are good actors who fare poorly buried in all that behavior and accoutrements. with the productions assets and deficits divided into such neat quadrants the bulk of credit and criticism must fall to director melora marshall who has placed physical and vocal obligations on performers who might have been better able to serve the play and entertain the audience without them. val millers costumes are also hit and miss. while there is some nice looking period garb the abundance of obviously synthetic material makes the wardrobe look overall cheap while some pieces are just plain off. beside the aforementioned cavewoman dresses there are velour pants and modern corduroy slacks. certain fairies are attired busily but not esthetically and others appear to be wearing items from their own closets. with the open stage and the woods as backdrop theres no set design but some set dressing. here again ragged bits of polyester cloth fail to evoke the desired mystical atmosphere and plastic flowers in the midst of all that natural greenery just look tacky. at the end of the play  urges us if weve been offended to imagine it was all a dream. but its hard to know what to make of a dream that is both wonderful and just plain weird. still even with its shortcomings and the difficulty understanding certain players theres enough to love here. beside the always satisfying experience of seeing  in this beautiful setting the better performances make it well worth the trip to the woods. but first you may want to read the play. ,3,Comedy,Negative
Midsummer Night's Dream,80s Throwback is a Dream,Denise Battista,ready for a throwback to the american 80s? then let impact theatre take you back to the era of great music bad hair and one heck of a lot of fun in their current production of a midsummer nights dream showing in the basement of la vals subterranean pizza in berkeley. packed with all the clicks and clubs we 80s kids remember so well this show will leave you singing out the door and for days to come.set in an 80s nightclub the gothic queen of the fairies sarah coykendall keeps her changeling boy to the dismay of her poppunk king  tim redmond who really wants this boy toy for his own. enter the lamentable  marissa keltie poor dear wearing an acid washed jacket fanny pack and french braid hot on the heels of the wall street bound  seth thygesen whose cell phone is bigger than his already inflated head.  follows the early madonna inspired  miyuki bierlein and her glampunk betrothed  nick jackson into the wood.  pete caslavka whos already known as a bit of a punk is a sexy little pistol committing anarchy all over the place including on the head of bottom casi maggio as the rest of her not so cool but oh so awesome posse of nerds prepare their version of a play to perform for the duke and duchess on their wedding day at night.  jordan winer would rather skip the festivities and lead his dynasty coiffed arm candy to bed while sarah thomas real life amazonian qualities permit her  to handle all the shots she throws back during the show.this show is fast and furious aside from the stoned out   giere who spends the play munching funyuns and casting moonshine as a burned out afterthought. each character in director melissa hillmans production hearkens back to some 80s icon.  conjures up ghostbusters snout reads a vintage copy of dynamite magazine perhaps the march 1985 ralph macchio edition? dressed as the karate kid and falling prey to some uncomfortably hysterical racial slurs in his rendition of wall. revenge of the nerds michael delaney snug and brian turner flute steal many a scene with their extemporaneous asides and self satisfied high fives as well as their ability to casually pick up on every sexual pun in this play.speaking of extemporaneous speech this production may surprise the purists out there. those of us who shy away from interpretations that impose additions not native to s tongue are in for a rude awakening because hillmans allowances actually work and work well partly because this troupe speaks the speech trippingly on the tongue as if  himself was there to coach them along. some of these asides may not be suitable for children under thirteen but they are well received by the rest of the age ranges including the retired community of the rossmoor  society who agreed 14 2 that this is a most favorable dream. adding even more fun to an already festive affair this retired community of  lovers wasnt too shy to stand up and groove to kajagoogoo during intermission.those sitting in the front row of this basement theatre will fall prey to poor s needy flirtations and will come dangerously close to being kicked in the head as  busts through the fourth wall. this up close and personal attention also offers great seats for  and s dance off taking us back to the days of the robot running man cabbage patch and snake.this production is missing a crucial element aside from the unreable set design 80s hair. yes the french braid works on keltie but it seems she and the rest of the female cast couldnt commit to the horrible spectacle of the aqua net inspired exploding bangs. i also cant help but think the mechanicals should have staged a concert rather than theatrical rendition of ovids tragedy considering the wedding parties convened in a dance club. other distractions that sometimes well distract are the pool players in the pizza joint up above and the occasional wind of mold in this underground theatre but oddly thats part of la vals charm. besides you can always drown out the pool game in a beer and trade up the mold for a slice. with these options alongside some really fun theatre youre sure to come out ahead high five from snug and flute for that one.so if youre hungry like the wolf for a little anarchy at the theatre dont be too shy. grab a slice upstairs relax with a beer and join this culture club for an iconic 80s dream of a show.,4,Comedy,Positive
Midsummer Night's Dream,Dream Away Time with RSC’s Magical Spectacle,Claudine Nightingale,this revival of greg dorans 2005 production of a midsummer nights dream at the novello sees the continuation of the rscs london season all of which were performed in stratford upon avon in the summer. following on from the unprecedented popularity of  this production has a hard act to follow which shows a little in the number of empty seats in the novello theatre the night i come to watch. despite the lack of celebrity attraction in this production it is an exciting and dynamic performance filled with the magical wonder that is needed to bring alive another outing of this so frequently performed  work. modern dress is the general costume concept which doran says he feels works particularly well in making the distinction between lovers as clear as possible. the mechanicals too appear in very familiar outfits which   combined with their thick birmingham accents creates a scene like so many street corners in the towns of middle england. initially the staging designed by francis oconnor appears stark and cold using the same mirrored floor and background as the set for . yet as the play progresses small touches transfer the clinical background into a twinkling dream world. a large full moon hangs high changing from a deep red to silver and is echoed with a large silhouetted lunar shape on the mirror backdrop which also changes colour in reaction to the scenes mood. dozens of orange bulbous lights are suspended on individual strings from the ceiling and move in and out of the stage area. it is now that the maintenance of the mirrored stage works so well as the lights multiply which when combined with the lunar symbols creates a celestial arena for this most magical of plays. the use of a silver crescent moon as s bed works especially well elevating her above the stage into the dark of the night sky above whilst the action continues beneath her. the lovers each give a strong performance illustrating well the folly and humour in this confusion of young love.  tom davey performs his role as a cool assured young adult. he is not the earnest man that could be interpreted from his lines but adds sarcasm which works surprisingly well. s nonchalant attitude at first appears to show none of the youthful exuberance one would expect yet instead he has a familiarly boyish determination which works to great effect.  played by kathryn drysdale also gives a sincere performance. bespeckled and dowdily dressed in a long beige cardigan we are given a forlorn  rather than the all too often grumpy and slightly farcical portrayal of this unfortunate youth.  de jerseys  is a surprisingly powerful force in this production. he portrays a very tangible and formidable omnipresence. the mechanicals as is so often the case in productions of the dream very nearly steal the show. pyramus and thisbe creates a constant stream of laughter each characters performance as funny as the last. with many of the cast returning to the rsc to revive their roles in the original 2005 production we are also treated with the return of joe dixon as bottom. dixons bottom is the most natural and unassuming performance of one of my most beloved an characters. dixon presents this humorous character with a total level of innocence and a sense of contentedness not often presented in this role. this is also a truly twenty first century bottom who raps and moonwalks when afeared to show them he is not afraid. credit must be given here to the most fantastic revolving beard prop which adds no end of humour to the initial mechanicals scene so often it is careful little details like this that make all the difference. bottoms head an enormous fluffy asss head with moving ears eyes and mouth is a wonderful highlight of the evening. the transformed bottoms appearance is not ludicrous but adorable as his ears swish from side to side in both fright and pleasure. another prop which s this production out from others is s little indian boy. instead of a small living child a doll is manipulated by the fairies to create a surprisingly well animated spectacle. the music by paul englishby is wonderfully atmospheric reflecting the mystical scenes on stage most effectively vaguely reminiscent of a harry potter soundtrack. the most sublime musical moment features as  restores harmony between the lovers with his potion a truly romantic and angelic passage. the only possible negative aspect would be a slight imbalance between instrumentalists and singing fairies during their two songs. that said the fairies are wonderfully conceived   appearing in tattered black outfits they appear a little dark in nature yet endearing at the same time. dorans direction is electric in the forest scene where the fairies watch on invisibly mocking the lovers. they whisper and confuse the lovers but in a way that is full of benevolence and provokes much laughter from the audience. the key this performance aside from the reuniting of many from the previous production to create a powerfully adept cast is the many small touches that combine together to make a performance larger than its parts. a good performance of the dream must sparkle and glow with magic and wonder. this is an elusive theatrical feat but one thing is for sure greg doran and the rsc have conjured it up by the bucket load.,4,Comedy,Positive
Midsummer Night's Dream,The Eye of Man Hath Not Heard What this Dream Was,Claudine Nightingale,its been seventeen years since the footsbarn theatre performed in their native britain. the international company of actors was established in 1971 and took up residence on a farm in france in 1991 still their home today. as is often their practice the performance takes place under a big top this time in the centre of victoria park. i have to confess dreading the thought of this as i arrive dripping wet and freezing cold as a result of the inclement english november weather. thankfully a well heated tent and a glass of mulled wine quickly wins me round. the atmosphere of this intimate venue buzzes with anticipation and is happily full of parents with young children this in itself is a credit to footsbarn. perhaps the parents have heard about the companys ethos on  and other theatrical classics. on their website they proudly claim their productions transcend the barrier of language with [a] unique blend of visual theatre music and magic. unfortunately for the actors and even more so for those who cherish the very language being transcended this is a little truer than one would like. the action begins with a burst of exotic musical flavours thanks to composer maurice horsthuis and musicians pawel paluch chandran and kasia klebba. unusual instrumental combinations of sitar and bassoon or bamboo flute cello and drum add to the mystical feel of the production. the costumes too are sumptuous in design magical and almost grotesque so much so a few of the younger children are startled into crying before even a word is spoken. this is perhaps not quite the desired effect but is at least evidence of the fine work of mask designer fredericka hayter and hannah sjodin on costumes. much good use of the theatrical space moving in and around the seating areas also helps to infuse the audience with the excitement of the spectacle. unfortunately disappointment sets in. i have no qualms with attempts to make  more accessible. it would also be fair to mention that my guest who claims to have little knowledge of  and a midsummer nights dream thoroughly enjoyed the production with few of my own reservations. perhaps i am too attached to the language itself to merely appreciate the visual spectacle but i find it hard to appreciate a production of  in which i cannot hear half of the words. s opening lines are lost and unclear as are s. when  akemi yamauchi appears in a later scene language barriers once again make many of her lines entirely inaudible even with the knowledge of what should have been said. s words are audible on the whole but sensible emphases and the flow of the pentameter are frustratingly awry. whilst it is admirable and pioneering for a travelling theatre company such as this to be truly international in its membership the impact this has upon the language of the play is too grave. to reinforce the nature theme that is the stronghold of this play director paddy hayter takes s words who would change a raven for a dove and creates a bizarrely avian theme around the lovers initial scene together with a pigeon like bristle of feathers confrontation between  vincent gracieux and  paddy hayter. though the lovers have some moments of entertaining interaction it is hard to feel any real emotions of passion and longing between them not least because of  and s distractingly advanced years. caroline piette as  gives the most convincing performance of the four whilst muriel piquarts  is far too insincere in her emotions with slapstick facial expressions and pantomime gestures. as can often be the case in productions of this popular play the mechanicals swoop in to save the day. whimsically and endearingly dressed the players benignly slapstick portrayal is developed and extended with certain textual improvisation presumably to be more inclusive for the younger members of the audience. the benevolent style of humour works well and is pleasantly entertaining but with no interval i found myself wishing on occasion for a less drawn out approach to the humour of the scenes. buck toothed bottom gives an original and jovial interpretation of the role and is a big hit with the children in the audience. his asss head is a highlight of the evening marvelously large and furry complete with mechanical mouth movements. joseph cunninghams  is a refreshing injection of gravitas and crisp diction. his presence dominates the forest action as he sits high in the tree planted centre stage.  too mas soegeng is full of exuberance and captures the imaginations of the youthful audience yet his gruff clumsy and bestial appearance is not the delightful nimble spirit of my imaginings. frighteningly goblin like fairies aging lovers and inaudible words make some aspects of this performance more of a nightmare than a dream although the circus like fantastical entertainment certainly will catch the attention of some. it is an enjoyable enough evening if you fancy a new and original experience but if you are going for the plays linguistic qualities you might be best to grab a copy of midsummer yourself and read aloud.,2,Comedy,Negative
Midsummer Night's Dream,Casual Grace and Loyalty Yielding But a Dream,Jack Morgan,the first thing you notice at north bay  is that hamilton amphitheater park is reably beautiful. why does it seem that every time the government closes a base in this case an air force base we find out that theyve been hogging all the prettiest land? its a shame hamilton amphitheater is hardly ever in use. its not only a sizable outdoor oasis but it also happens to boast possibly the best acoustics ive ever encountered in a theater of its kind. the actors voices really snap and you can hear even the faintest asides and breathy reactions. the people of novato are truly blessed with this lovely space which will be hosting north bay s as you like it and comedy of errors next season and director hector correas a midsummer nights dream for the rest of this one through october 5 2008. this happy group of players presents a most thoroughly refreshing production of midsummer as our bay area summer comes to a hotter than usual close. correa whos also directed at the american conservatory theater and berkeley rep. isnt afraid to let the plays language do most of the heavy lifting. in an theater the less you feel the directors touch the better the production. much of the beauty of a midsummer nights dream lies in subtlety and correa shows his adherence to a belief in casual grace and a loyalty to  by resisting the urge that so many directors fall victim to that urge that drives them to over sexualize or overtly push a subjective interpretation on an audience. correa has obviously found a way to inspire the company to do their best work without stifling the writer everyone ostensibly came to see. frankly i wish more directors would do the same. costume design becomes much more delicate when companies are working with doubling and bessie delucchi like a philippe petit of costume does a tremendous amount with very little. sure there are tutus on the fairies and long ears on bottom but there are also fluttering birds and butterflies on sticks and heart shaped sunglasses and great wigs. my favorite is  l. jeffrey moore who somehow simultaneously embodies the stern order of s might and the discord and humor of the fairy world in a short suit and vest mottled stockings and glitter. it might have helped that moore is the tallest person on the stage but the costume itself is perfect. the stage and scene by rose ann raphael and liz seibert are true accomplishments as well. quite often sets that are too simple lose the magical foresty stuff. and the reverse can also occur ive seen midsummers that work so hard to make the set jungley only to lose the contrast between the law and order of the court and the freedom of the forest. raphael and seibert find a happy medium that sacrifices nothing. plus theres a gigantic yellow moon stage right that enhances my own favorite scene in the play. my favorite scene is when moonshine played by kyle stampfli in this production gets fed up with the peanut gallery and snaps at  stanley spenger. the short interchange foils the fear of hanging expressed earlier by the rude mechanicals and it kicks off an elegant echo of all the moon talk at the plays opening between  and  marissa keltie. the echo ends with one of my favorite lines in all of  moonshine and lion are left to bury the dead. the line comes from  after everyone elses favorite part the mucked up death scene of pyramus and thisbe played here by ben knoll and brady g. boys respectively and expertly to win lots of laughs. the playbill conspicuously leaves out the rude mechanicals manager   but if you were paying attention at the beginning of the production when artistic director jeffrey trotter introduces the show and asks people to sign up for their emailing list youll notice that it is he who takes on the role of  and manages our beloved hard handed boys. its a warm nod in the direction of everyone who likes to think about  playing that part and a small reward to all the good audience members who listen to the preshow stuff. equally amusing are harold pierce and joe lazzaretti as  and  who are completely believable as competitive young men in love with young women and competition itself. they are consumed by their foolishness to the point that they dont care how foolish theyre being even if they realize it. and the women for whom they strut and fret are delightful. jayne deely  has a way of speaking with a very slight lisp that is so adorable you cant help but fall in love with her and wonder what  is thinking. and beth deitchman has a glowing presence that cannot be ignored as . the two women present a conundrum indeed. they seem like life long friends sharing a cute special handshake and both of them are worth fighting over. ben knoll as bottom brings something sweet and sad to the role. he isnt just someone to laugh at but also someone to care about a deeper character than most permit and knoll nails it. all of the actors perform pretty wonderfully including a surprisingly memorable skinny squeaky voiced fairy and  played by elspeth kohler. i dont think ive ever called  in a midsummer nights dream unforgettable but that is certainly the term i would use here and refreshingly so. north bay  encourages picnicking and their patrons are as down to earth as their company inviting all out for a delightfully dreamy experience.,5,Comedy,Positive
Midsummer Night's Dream,Late-summer Midsummer Lulls,Matthew Kellen Burgos,as one walks into the will geer theatricum botanicum space one cannot help but think it perfectly suited for s a midsummer nights dream. the building itself nestled in the topanga canyon valley the natural canopy of an early evening sky spotted with stars and the backdrop of an aesthetically pleasing forest all make for a lovely if not poetic environment. yet in spite of the incredibly appropriate surroundings this late summer midsummer falls predictably flat. melora marshalls vision of the show is fairly straight forward. there are no heavy visual concepts imposed on the story or characters. there is no auteuring of the bards words. all the basic elements of the show are intact. unfortunately intact is where they remain. the staging is adequate but provides little to illuminate any particular moment or aspect of the text. the most unfortunate facet of the staging is the use of the wonderful depth of the space. so many times the opportunity arises to make use of the beautiful forest in the background for something other than entrances but entrances and exits are the only stroke that paints the canyons canvas. lexi pearls movement choreography is the most interesting visual element but in the end feels slightly amateur mostly due to the inconsistency in execution by the participating members of the cast. the magic of midsummer is shared through the movement and live sound effects which are fairly successful but with little payoff as a whole. the costumes created by christopher scott murillo and lexi pearl are uninspired and in combination with the vanilla lighting design michael mahlum lacks palate or punch. overall the surreal journey of the lovers plays literal and fairly bland throughout. the performances match the design with surprising consistency. the lovers are believable and little else with the most engaging performance being that of willow geer as . meredith m. sweeney lacks the fire as  to counter the fluid  but still gives a strong and consistent performance. elizabeth tobias takes the most risks as  executing a fascinating physical and vocal characterization. tobias seems a tad over directed but shows clear presence and control as the androgynous sprite.  and  fill the space with presence and voice but fail to make a  on the memory with anything unique or reable. abby craden  is also consistent but at times seems lost in the language. michael mcfall as  on the other hand commands the language but feels forced and lacks levels. however the most disappointing performance is that of thad geer as bottom. with the incredibly ample humor present in each of the rude mechanical scenes geer plays for laughs and lacks all nuance and subtlety with the language missing many wonderful puns and pranks with his fellow players. the rest of the cast moves throughout the story with relative ease but very little stands out by the time the curtain of night falls down on the evenings performance. if youre looking for an evening of outdoor  that is clear and light the theatricum botanicum will serve. if you are looking for some bang for your buck then its possible this particular midsummer may leave you napping. and though fun and energy keep the production afloat this dream may end up being only slightly more interesting than reality.,3,Comedy,Negative
Midsummer Night's Dream,A Midsummer Children's Dream,Claudine Nightingale,despite the early start a healthy crowd of families gather round to see the opening performance of open air theatres re imagination of a midsummer nights dream specially adapted to introduce  to children aged six and over. based on the theme of a traditional childrens playroom the characters appear as rag dolls toy soldiers clowns and music box dancers surrounded by alphabet blocks toy drums and a large toy box. the prologue lead by the friendly and inviting bottom dale superville works well to lay the plot and to as clearly as possible explain the complex relationship between the four young lovers. from the very start a relationship is established between actor and audience through interchange and audience participation. bottom is by far the most loved of the characters in this production apparent in the eyes of children and adults alike. unsure about just how much  would remain in this re imagined dream i was surprised that following the prologue nearly all dialogue is the original text. the entire cast is careful to emphasise the language in such a way to make it as clear as possible for the younger than usual audience including greater use of gesture and physical expression. my seven year old companion assured me it is easy to follow the plot not seeming to find the language a barrier at all.  matthew hart dressed like an acrobatic clown gives a particularly captivating performance grabbing the attention of the young audience as his ballet inspired movements take him sneakily in and around each scene. hart cleverly creates a convincing atmosphere of mysticism around the character. the production also encourages introducing children to acting with about a half dozen taking on small roles such as moonshine and wall. as well as a good way to encourage involvement in  at a young age director dominic leclercs production also provides much impromptu entertainment. particular highlights in this performance include a fairys shocked exclamation as bottoms donkey tail falls off whilst climbing into bed and mischievous moonshine who spends the entirety of his theatrical debut wildly and perilously swinging his lantern to and fro much to the anxiety and amusement of the actors and the adults in the audience. pyramus and thisbes play within this playtime is the climax of the production and what a highlight it is. supervilles humorously drawn out death scene as pyramus leaves the audience in fits of laughter and is a wonderful introduction to s trade protracted death scenes in a theatre filled with giggling enthusiasts. a perfect play to choose for such an adaptation and a noble endeavour this production is enjoyable and accessible for children even as young as they suggest and aside from its educational virtues it also acts as a wonderfully innovative piece of light vivid playful entertainment.,5,Comedy,Positive
Midsummer Night's Dream,A Midsummer to Linga Over,Tanya Gough,tim supples subcontinent inspired production of a midsummer nights dream engaged at torontos luminato festival of the arts 2008 is colorful acrobatic and entirely liberating although it also presents significant challenges.supple casts his midsummer entirely in mumbai india with cast and crew coming from all over india and sri lanka bringing with them a mélange of acting styles and native languages. instead of forcing his actors to speak an english throughout supple instead gave them the freedom to revert to their native or any other language they were comfortable speaking if and when it was deemed appropriate with the caveat that all language would adhere to the original through careful and discerning translation. the result is that one character may speak only in english others primarily in hindi or punjabi or any one of a host of languages common to the indian sub continent. in some cases a character may even begin a speech in one language and switch halfway through to another finding the language which best expresses the emotional thrust of the text.now granted this technique is not easy to follow along and i expect that viewers less familiar with the text might be completely alienated by it. others will find the experience is akin to seeing a favorite opera production where the sur titles only show sporadically. one knows the story well enough to follow along and its easy enough to recognize the highlights whether theyre in english or not. the end result is entirely liberating. rather than being pinned to the language and the insistent iambic pentameter speeches are suddenly converted into entirely new creatures. even the original text becomes freed from standard rhythms when spoken by those for whom english is not a native tongue.this sort of linguistic integration is not new to  productions in india most notably in roysten abels film in  based on his stage play by the same name. in abels film the line between reality and theatre become blurred à la a double life during a mixed language production of . various plays have been appropriated and adapted into a wide range of native indian tongues including the hindi angoor based on a comedy of errors the urdu and hindi maqbool  and countless bollywood versions not to mention  wallah the classic merchant ivory tale of an actors trying to adapt to a world in which british rule is rapidly becoming unacceptable. in a country characterized by multi lingualism what better way to adapt  to your native culture than to re create the text with the rhythms and complexity of your native languages?granted the language issue is a difficult one and i can certainly understand how others may be less enthralled by it than i. but equally liberating is the sheer physicality of the production which makes full use of the stage space with a creativity i have never seen before. the action does not move simply back and forth across the stage it climbs the bamboo ladder grid upstage and dangles from every inch of free space above the stage. the action is physical and acrobatic infusing every moment with a visual carnival of color and motion often integrating traditional elements of indian regional acting styles music and dance. that said i the acting is somewhat inconsistent. the charming and devilish  ajay kumar struts across the stage mugging to the audience even when it is not quite clear why he is there. bottom the weaver played with great aplomb by the bearish joy fernandes seems to be slightly off the rhythm of the rest of the play for reasons i cannot pinpoint and i should say my discomfort has nothing to do with the penile gourd he sports with his donkey head more on that point anon. both of the girls shanaya rafaat as  and yuki ellias as  bring a rare power and vitality to these roles which often suffer from an overbearing sweetness in western productions.and finally there is the sex. the entire production is played out with an unassuming looking black pillar placed downstage center. for the uninitiated this is a large black lingam a phallic pillar with an ancient history tied to indian and asian religions to the beginning of human history. this one in particular is quite unassuming   a black pillar of sorts with no phallic decorations or attributes to offend the western audience. nevertheless it serves the important purpose of consecrating the production to the gods of sex and sexuality  does this by rubbing water on the pillar and performing a rite of dedication at the start of the play which to me seems an entirely appropriate and brilliant way to associate the text with indian culture. the lingam remains front and center throughout the entire show as a constant reminder that a midsummers night dream is ultimately about love. i find it fascinating that others should read rape where i read raw sexuality. my problem with those instances had less to do with the apparent violence of say  advancing on . rather i was confused by the womens reactions which seemed to me to be a bit too willing given the context of the play. similarly bottoms reddened phallus a symbolic gourd worn at the waist is an organic and appropriate reminder of the sexuality to which the production is dedicated.apart from some minor inconsistencies in the performances this production is a welcome and highly energizing experience. if you need your  to be packaged in flouncy shirts and ruffled collars then do yourself a favor and stay home. if on the other hand you are tired of cute fairies and superficially imposed innocence then this production is the perfect way to wipe the slate clean and reinvigorate your concept of what a midsummer nights dream should be.,4,Comedy,Positive
All's Well That Ends Well,A Highly Enchanting Dream in Hi-Def,Ron Severdia,its been a long time coming. the age of  has now entered todays world of high definition and its about time. now opus arte has the honor of becoming the first label to distribute a an production on blu ray hd with the ballet of mendelssohns a midsummer nights dream. for those readers new to the world of hd it offers a picture resolution with almost triple the resolution of standard dvds while maintaining the aspect ratio of the original film the way the director intended it. in the united states televisions run at 30 frames per second and film runs at 24 frames per second so theres a conversion called a pulldown for every film thats converted to dvd. high definition formats work more like film so theres no conversion needed. hd can also have the holy grail of audio uncompressed sound enabling the listener to hear incredible detail. once youve experienced a film on hd its very hard to go back to standard television or plain ol dvds. upon launching the dvd the menus show a clean and simple design of monochromatic silhouettes evoking forest and fairies to come. a short overture and shots of a real forest dissolve into the opening twitter of fairies. the set is a blue nighttime sky with tree silhouettes augmented in each scene by oversized flowers and greek style columns. its not long before the magical and athletic dancing of  seth belliston instantaneously energizes the stage. belliston is a delight to watch in every scene as he glides effortlessly across the stage making mischief. long time company member patricia barker  has no equal on stage even if its pacific northwests principal paul gibson a local san  ballet alumni. while gibson is suitably regal as  barker is the epitome of grace and poise with every gesture she makes. as the crown jewel of pnb barker retired last season. her presence is sure to be sorely missed. the rude mechanicals are very much secondary even tertiary aspects of this production. their dancing is minimal if at all and timothy lynch as bottom is rather unreable. much of his role is literally lost in translation and minimized in this balletic interpretation. the result is only a flat caricature. the exquisite costuming shines the most in what is arguably mendelssohns most well known tune the wedding march. in one of george balanchines choreographed numbers some 40 dancers hijack the story for an elaborate number. this is balanchines first original full length ballet and surely he was carried away by the sweeping melodies of the bbc concert orchestra. all in all this is a lovely production and opus arte deserves high praise for being the first out of the gate and for removing regional encoding so its playable worldwide. there are a few other  titles in their canon that have yet to be released in hd but now that the format war is over those and many other titles should be forthcoming. advance hd schedules from other studios show no  titles planned through the end of 2008 and that further demonstrates how far ahead of the curve they really are. additional rating criteria overall film 4 stars the dancing is sublime and the production values are breathtaking. though the choreography is a bit over indulgent and a few of the dancers are a tad on the melodramatic side this is a solid production. video quality 4 stars overall quite good but some shots are simply out of focus. this is surely less noticeable on a regular standard definition television but you cant hide from hd quality. theres a ed difference between many shots throughout the dvd that show below average camera work. as a fan of hd i guess ive been spoiled by the land discovery channel series planet earth. audio quality 5 stars if you dont have uncompressed audio which more and more studios are offering on their high definition dvds then pcm 5.1 is a very satisfying alternative. the only anomaly is the audio cuts out halfway through the curtain call. bonus extras 1 star some of the recent hd operatic productions from great performances on pbs have offered a glimpse a what goes on backstage between scenes and set changes. the camera never stops rolling and this is a wonderful way to enhance a theatrical performance and let the audience in on aspects theyve never seen before. backstage clips or behind the scenes glimpses should be standard on all performance dvds. this dvd just cuts to each act or scene and the only thing offered as supplementary material is a cast photo gallery of shots from the production. also included is a program booklet in english french  german helping the viewer follow along with the story. important note you need a blu ray dvd player and a hd television to watch this disc.,4,Comedy,Positive
Midsummer Night's Dream,Vulgarity and Violence Turn Shakespeare’s Dream into A Cock and Bull Nightmare,Denise Battista,once upon a time there were some hard handed men as well as four lovers who journeyed into the woods. they happened upon some fairies and a hobgoblin who sprinkled them with fairy magic. suddenly their lives were oertaken by violence two near rapes an enormous and reddened phallus bouncing round and an explanation of all this action in seven of eight tongues of which i am not anywhere near native.director tim supples re imagined dream makes its 2008 north american premiere at the curran theatre in san  after debuting in 2006 in india and at italys verona festival followed by a sold out run at the swan theatre in stratford upon avon and then various runs to full houses in the uk india and australia in 2007. the production boasts to incorporate six indian and two sri lankan dialects into this english language performance. it seems more appropriate to say that english is occasionally incorporated and even with like the back of your hand knowledge of this play supples dream proves difficult to grasp.language barriers aside the cast turns to highly physical theatre in order to attempt to tell the audience about their dream ranging from strong and emotional gestures mediocre to fairly impressive cirque du soleil esque rope tricks rhythmic south asian dancing to well choreographed wrestling matches led by choreographers d. padmakumar and m. palani all set to the tune of music director devissaros onstage musicians providing impressive percussive beats to which this multi cultural troupe struts and frets their two and half hours upon the stage.the curran theater does not offer fair sight of sumant jayakrishnans set design jayakrishnan is also responsible for this productions sexy and vibrant costuming although the draped jungle gym of a backdrop is intriguing and brilliantly lit by zuleikha chaudharis lighting design. down stage center is a separate plot of ground the stage floor is covered with dry soil measuring about 2x 8 in which lies what looks to be a walking stick. how do i know this? i took a moment to walk to the edge of the stage stand on my toes and take a peek at what ought to be somehow revealed to the audience at some point during the play. then again it would be nice to gauge the purpose of this plot and i mean that in the broadest sense of the word. there is also an interesting instrument down center that when rubbed the right way by either and only  or  both characters played with pizzazz by ajay kumar produces a vibrating tone reminiscent of a tibetan prayer bowl. the sound somehow enters the soul in a dreamy sort of way but finding method in its measure is a mystery.its difficult to focus on anything but the overt vulgarity of this production. it is sexual not sensual. it is violent not dramatic. it leads one to gasp rather than sigh. it moves up a lot of dinner reservations as a high percentage of the audience on opening night did not return after intermission. perhaps it is the incoherent and overplayed screaming of j. jayakumar  as he ferociously reprimands his daughter for disobeying his orders. perhaps it is the shock of s infidelity to  when she falls into lusty embrace with  prasanna mahagamage. perhaps it is s chandan roy sanyal violent attempted rape of . perhaps it is the fact that its impossible to fall in love with nick bottom the weaver joy fernandes when he is such a barbaric animal growling stomping with his arms gigantically above him and lugging around a huge and bouncing bright red dildo roped around his groin as he literally and repeatedly moos in ecstasy and does a loutish dance in celebration that takes one back to an era that one ought to leave well enough alone. yes the dreaded lawnmower era. perhaps its because the curran theater is hot as hades or perhaps its the not quite adequately performed physical theatre that fails to speak all the lines that are missing in this production even if you look in between. if this is the future of  then i must be getting damned old.,2,Comedy,Negative
Midsummer Night's Dream,OSF Acknowledges Our Changeling World,Denise Battista,the oregon  festival opens its seventy three year old doors to new a season of change. paul nicholson celebrating twenty nine years as executive director at osf and bill rauch kicking off his first season as the festivals artistic director introduce what they call a merging of the old and the new while acknowledging our increasingly global world. the season bursts onto the scene in the  bowmer theatre with  ruckers young and sexy a midsummer nights dream followed by director leah c. gardiners dramatic poetic and highly recommended production of august wilsons pulitzer prize winning play fences which offers insight into the african american experience during the transitional time of 1957 1965. bill rauch directs his version of the two thousand year old sanskrit play the clay cart offering love lust intrigue some very an cases of mistaken identity and much comedy proving a feast for the eyes and ears. to complete this opening tetralogy the soft spoken but heavy hitting playwright julie marie myatt blesses this festival in the new theatre with the world premiere of her play welcome home jenny sutter directed by jessica thebus. myatt not only tells jennys story as a woman coming home after her service as a marine in iraq but also acknowledges all who have suffered through war. jenny sutter is moving and generates thought and conversation even if one cant quite come up with the right words to say. these four productions are in many ways very different but rauch has done a magical job at creating syntheses and ties that bind them together. alison carey the newly appointed director of the u.s. history cycle which looks forward to opening its first of thirty seven productions in 2010 gave me the best advice to offer you when embarking on this brave new world of plays at osf. pay attention to the details. why is this the best advice? because its the details that provoke the ideas that lead to the vision of the insightful bigger picture. let us acknowledge and learn from the past embrace the changes and transitions of the present look forward with hope to the future and celebrate the knotted girdle that ties these worlds together.  rucker introduces one of this seasons main themes in a midsummer nights dream by emphasizing the role of the changeling boy. in s play the boy who  abducts from his indian father presumably exchanging him with another child is not represented by an actual physical character and is only referred to three times before being shuffled from our consideration.  does give the boy an indirect voice however by incorporating a literary device referred to by  contemporary george puttenham the arte of english poesie as the changeling. the device creates an absurd exchange in syntax that in the end offers more pleasure to the ear than the more sensible version. most notably this device is experienced in bottoms famous account of 1 thians when he expounds that the eye of man hath not heard he ear of man hath not seen  rucker monopolizes on this device by creating a physical though true to s text non speaking role for the changeling boy interchanged between collin  and kevin weatherby and by emphasizing the many ways in which this word can be defined. the inconstant lovers change the objects of their desire throughout the play some due and some not to s mischief in the wood. bottom is physically changed into an ass and then back again into his own human version of the connotation. the fairy queen straightway falls in love with this ass and once her sight is restored she turns it back to her . the traditional roles of men and women are also reversed at times with ruckers production emphasizing strong and passionate women in the amazon queen in  and her pursuit of  in  when she disobeys  her mother in this production and in  and her decision to defy her husband. but enough of this. onto the sexy. set design in midsummer is best described as industrial feminine strong and sensual. scenic designer walt spangler and lighting designer robert son work together to create a 20th century industrial feel while rucker gives a nod to the preceding four decades through music dance costume and various revelry throughout. inside the walls of athens the set comprised of large metal structures is a left to right almost mirror image framing the action resembling dare i say a woman in a compromising position. these structures change direction to signify entrance into the athenian wood and become tree like on which the fairies climb perch spy and at the right moments thanks to sons insightful lighting design make the mesmerizing fairies invisible for the sake of the action on other parts of the stage. imposing neon stars loom above and a beaming disco ball invites the audience into the dance party of the year.  roths costume design which according to word on the street has gone from r rated in the previews to a now more kid friendly pg is sexy flirty and in the fairy realm out of this world. the athenian court is bright and white clean and pristine in dress while the wood is the closet for the late eighties early nineties underground dance scene. roth creates a fine ass out of bottom ray porter arming him with a couple of handy hooves and some long and hairy ears. although porter does nothing in particular to steal the show his comedic commands to fairies  neil shah  edgar miguel sanchez and  eddie lopez under the guidance of the hornèd moth and first fairy  bedard for such things as a good scratch or a bottle of hay proves entertaining due to some prominent fairy eye rolls. the emphasis in this production is by all means on the flamboyant fairies and that knavish sprite robin goodfellow.  tufts brilliantly embraces his role as  obviously enjoying every toes together stance and every jim careyesque turn made all the more entertaining by his six inch wingèd platform boots while seizing any opportunity to break into dance or grab the mic and sing a loungey tune. his already strong brow with the help of some ingenious makeup design lends itself to the goat like attributes of the mythological . tufts leads the flaming fashionista fairies the lot wearing tutus and mesh tanks oddly more erotic than it sounds in their mischief and mayhem as well as some in sync dance moves that lead one to believe that these fairies got hold the movie blades of glory in preparation for this dream. in the spirit of change the lovers clothing goes through its own transitions thanks to the thieving fairies and some subtle dyeing techniques that introduce themselves from scene to scene.  and  are an unlikely pair that somehow work. shona tucker moves like a cat and plays the amazon queen with a seductive eartha kitt purrgrowl oozing sex appeal. tucker generates ample laughs when she is visibly horrified by the idea that poor  may have to engage in an austere and single life on dianes altar. michael elich portrays  as a new york wise guy. think a polished paulie walnuts sopranos in his younger days with the slicked back hair the pronounced ny italian american accent lots of show to his style and of course less the swearing.  won  with his sword but on this stage he woos her with diamond trinkets and his audience with his comedic timing. kevin kenerly and christine albright portray the fairy king and queen and battle it out in a seductive tug of war over the changeling boy. kenerlys usual precise diction and distinct authoritative tone works to his benefit as the one character in this play who holds power over all the others. his costume is like a buffed out bird into bondage echoing tina turner in beyond the thunderdome and king xerxes in jack snyders film 300. albright is strong and passionate sexy and bound tightly in her bustiers. she also sings one heck of a tune as her fairies dance an aerobic round in the strobe lit theatre. emily sophia knapp is short of stature but strong of both spit and fire as . her youth and imposed feminine naiveté is emphasized by her wide eyes and her toes pointing inward stance while  kjerstine anderson is a whole head about her competition towering like a maypole over the dwarfish knapp. the two initially share the same hairstyles the same white stockings and similar white dresses perhaps emphasizing the notion that in the coming scenes the two are destined to be interchangeable. tasso feldman as  outdoes his competition as a bright faced youthful energetic and dramatic athenian youth with all the appropriate raging hormones. he writhes on the floor in admiration of his lady love and seems about to jump out of his skin with enthusiasm when relaying his plan to steal into the woods. feldman and christopher michael rivera as  battle it out center stage showing their fighting prowess by snapping at their own padded boxers. the rude mechanicals are powerful as they roll onto the scene in their flowered vw bus although i have to note ive recently seen this vehicular device in theatreworks summer of love production of twelfth night in mountain view ca. here however the boys and girl are a troupe of aging hippies and summer of lovers with a delightfully terrible sense of style. eileen desandre as flute who seems to have swapped out an x for a y chromosome for this part jumps upon every line that insinuates she is a man who should not be playing the role of a woman. richard elmore as  puts name into action chomping on bugles and apples throughout the play based on his appearance alone he could have easily walked out with a pint of cherry garcia. the play with the play is fun and perfectly ridiculous with considerable laughs arising from the antics of the beloved josiah phillips as snout and his lips penetrating the crannied hole or chink during his presentation of wall. in an hysterical turn of events linda alper plays s mother versus father  as a yenta who carries a purse full of tricks and a comedic neurosis that speaks stereotypical volumes. rather than usher alper off the stage at the end of the play like  does to the brooding and disagreeable  rucker creates concord out of discord by permitting alper to join the lovers who join us in the audience so we may all together enjoy the mechanicals play. but what of that changeling boy? how does rucker achieve harmony there? the boys presence and eventual exit follows that insightful bigger picture i was talking about way back when. the discord of the play is caused by the mere presence of the boy.  wants him.  wants him. they fight and as a result the natural world is in disorder and layers upon layers of chaos follow. once the exchange of the boy is complete the boy becomes insignificant. in this case he sort of shrugs and leaves the stage of his own accord. his presence is replaced by the future. besides the changeling has places to go people to see. he finds a voice in clay cart he takes shape in fences and if you pay attention to detail youll find that he walks the stage throughout jenny sutter. all of these plays end with a notion of hope and look toward the future breathing light into the sometimes darkness that can pervade a dream.,4,Comedy,Positive
Midsummer Night's Dream,San Francisco Shakespeare Hits It with a Lusty Dream,Denise Battista,at the end of a midsummer nights dream  wants us to perhaps consider the play no more yielding but a dream. director kenneth kelleher on the other hand gives us a play that is just that. the initial stage carries a framing tale of sorts with a separate foot and headboard center stage between which  and  fall asleep. once asleep the foot and headboard part to far stage left and right signifying that what happens next and until the duke and his reluctant bride awake the following day is indeed one fantastic dream. kellehers production has certainly made its rounds. since the end of june theyve traveled from pleasanton to cupertino to san mateo and finally home to san  where any rough spots have been smoothed and any hodgepodge sorted out. they are also welcomed home by a loyal and smart san  audience filled with patrons who seem to comprehend every analogy every play on words and every single delectably dirty pun no matter how obscure. music plays a fair part in this production running a thematic gamut with narcolepsy ben folds five wrap your troubles in dreams velvet underground s lip synced substitution for her ovidian lullaby lets dream in the moonlight billie holiday a cleaned up version of ludacris go to sleep dandy warhols sensually staged sleep a rendition of cole porters what is this thing called love? and a guest appearance by the parrots of telegraph hill. san s wind engages in a bit of foul play revealing trap doors and blowing turf right into the hands of  but  sousa ad libs a bit and the audience is more than forgiving with their hands. there are four discordant storylines in midsummer  and  the lovers the mechanicals and the fairies  that must somehow come together in order to achieve the inevitable concord of a an comedy. fair  may call the moon inconstant but in this play it is the one constant that unites these four stories. this conceit is prevalent throughout the play with the word moon raised in various ways some twenty eight times. kelleher incorporates this conceit as well as his own version of the moon a large white medicine ball in a clever way guiding everyone through their own phases and transformations and leading all toward a conclusion of enlightenment. and like most dreams this one is both beautiful and bizarre. michael c. storm plays  as a staunch misogynistic duke who looks as though he marched out of stalins army rather than the ancient greek battlefield and  played by emily jordan is a conquest and a captive more charmed by the moon than by her fiancées harsh demeanor. but once asleep the two awake and tear off their overcoats in revolution transforming into a skintight clad fairy king and queen who look like they stepped straight out of barbarella.  played by rowan brooks who also doubles as the alarm clock carrying  and all the fairies may very well have missed the art car to burning man. brooks sports a pair of goggles and shows off a tight little pack of six through an open yellow vest as he lusts after titianias fairies who strut and tease over hill and dale wearing their own goggles as well as red lace petticoats and platinum wigs. storm and brooks are a great team. storms  is comparable to a greek god who is perhaps a bit bored and chooses to play with both mortals and not for the sake of sport ending each sinister plot with a goofy laugh. brooks carries out these plots with fabulous british diction great energy and excitement and the two together are so very pleased with themselves. when not running errands for  brooks is busy stealing clothing and trinkets from anyone he happens upon. fairies    and moth are grotesque and colorful versions of various creatures a goat a dog a rooster and a praying mantis is my guess and are if nothing else a visually unsettling part of this dream. our mechanicals are vaudevillian in nature wearing black suits with whitened faces and perform a perfectly over the top version of pyramus and thisbe that will leave your belly aching from laughter. gary s. martinez is spectacular playing the know it all bottom with a lot of character and a lot of panache. with every movement martinez strikes a pose every pose delivers theatrics and his theatrics generate loads of laughs. his big reveal in donkey garb is somewhat anticlimactic but the show soon reaches its peak again as the fairy queen falls in mad love with an ass straddling him and proceeding to tame her lover with a riding crop. this is all well met by martinezs submissive hee haw the sideshow or animal act of this vaudeville show is represented by david fierro who delivers a disturbing version of snug the joiner. fierro plays a simpleton who wears a rope leash around his rotundly postured belly which is either held by snout mick mize or tied to something offstage. on the one hand fierro is sweet and endearing to the point of engaging or forcing  into a hug after his portrayal of lion. on the other hand one must question why this man with a rubber face of expressions must at all times be on a thick rope leash.  and  played by  grazia affinito and summer serafin respectively enter the play like night and day. affinito also looks as though she may hitch a ride to black rock with the fairies wearing a black lace petticoat black hoodie moon boots and glasses not goggles. the poor dear is angry and seems bipolar and without her meds but when not riding her roller coaster of emotions affinito is engaging in soliloquy and an equal comedic rival for . serafin plays  as a manipulative pretty little princess who moves like a dancer upon the stage and speaks in a baby voice to get what she wants. serafin resorts to violence and her prim demeanor turns fierce once things in the play stop going her way leading her to stand on point every time affinito calls her little. the objects of their affection  sousa and  nicholas pelczar are appropriately interchangeable in demeanor but in appearance sousa is every parents dream while pelczar presents himself in a public enemy t shirt a flannel wrapped round his waist and a yellow ski cap the latter of which is lifted by the thieving . the end of this dream is deliciously confusing and jumbled like many dreams are just before you awake. what seemed so clear before is now cloudy and hazy whereupon waking it is sometimes difficult to gauge what is real and what is not.  and  and their sweet friends are to bed after making a collective moan over the mechanicals wondrous strange show but the duke and his new duchess awake again transformed into fairies.  transforms into  to sweep the stage. the moon which begins in the hands of  remains constant as it lands in the hands of  permitting brooks to begin and end the show full circle.,5,Comedy,Positive
Midsummer Night's Dream,A Midsummer for All Ages,Tanya Gough,this years canstage production of a midsummer nights dream at high park directed by ahdri zhina mandiela is a heavily but deftly cut adaptation with a strong caribbean flavor. clocking in at just one hour and thirty minutes the play has been stripped to its bare essentials but the text that is left contributes to a quickly paced lively production that is especially well suited for folk looking to get their  feet wet without being overwhelmed by language or plot. the set is simple but highly functional with two platform levels connected by semi circular staircases on either side. the staircase is fronted by a series of vertical metal poles which serve as hints of walls when in athens and are reminiscent of bamboo and tree trunks in the forest. the front of the upper platform is similarly grated but with two large doors that open and close. these doors have a further set of smaller doors in the lower level which provide a simple yet creative way to vary an otherwise bare stage. additional props and stage dressing are kept to a minimum except for the use of cheerful colored lights a collection of tall leaves imprinted with text to serve as the jungle and some gold hoops placed under the upper platform to suggest s magical lair.  the actors do sometimes get lost in the enormity of the stage but for the most part acquit themselves well. kevin hanchards  and karen robinsons  bring a strong caribbean sound to their roles much like david harewood and adjoa andoh in the recent arkangel audio editions of the play. former cirque du soleil performer colin heath is a decidedly acrobatic and energetic . of the mechanicals matthew kabwes bottom is not so well paced but steven gallaghers  is suitably officious and emberly doherty awkwardly adorable as the reticent snug. the role of  is here cast as a woman of the golf playing clubhouse type and this switch generally works well with parallel concerns for maintaining social class helping to soften the severity of  demands. there is no doubt the actors are having a great time onstage though the edges frequently unravel whenever they have trouble keeping pace. even with microphones some of the characters are difficult to hear in some cases due to the sound system cutting out and in because the actors lack the basic lung power to project sufficiently. this is especially true of the higher pitched characters such as holly lewis . and maev beatys frenetic yoga practicing  whose fast pacing often outruns lung capacity. part of the problem seems to be inexperience with outdoor theatre and this is compounded by the sheer size of the stage which actors sometimes lack the confidence and power to fill sufficiently.  one of the more interesting choices however is the casting of  cayonne a toronto spoken word poet as . cayonne approaches the text in a novel way breaking it down and deconstructing it turning his declarations of love into discombobulated hip hop rhythms of repetition and strategic stuttering. the result is a cross between a tongue tied lover and sophisticated enticing poet though cayonne sometimes lacks the basic acting chops to sell the latter. he would have a much easier time selling the word play to the audience if he brought more confidence to the first half of the play when the style is being introduced. its a fascinating idea but doesnt yet fulfill its potential. much of the joyfulness of this production is conveyed through costume which appears to be a cross between urban funk and caribana pageantry. many of the athenians are dressed in simple modern outfits made of or containing white cotton which evokes the traditional white toga associated with athens. the mechanicals are suitably mismatched in brightly colored plaids and patches.  and  appear in a series of costumes each one more flamboyant than the next. s giant peacock style pantsuit is made from giant leaves like those that dress the set while s brilliantly colored patchwork dress carries an enormous train and her gold gown with gold wire hoops attached to the back serve as wings. the fairies are a trio of hip hop hippies dressed in neon pinks and yellows and torn up denim. overall this is a family friendly production and a solid introduction to . though a bit thin on the performance side the audience is never bored and its a lovely way to spend a midsummer night.,3,Comedy,Negative
Midsummer Night's Dream,All the Wood's a Stage,Denise Battista,it takes a lot to get a city girl out of the city and even more to trek her into the woods on a saturday afternoon for a hikeplay. but i was encouraged by the possibility of my first good showing of a midsummer nights dream directed by the risk taking yet detail oriented stuart bousel. off i go san  to the atmostheatre in woodside with a gnawing skepticism guiding my way toward this productions first preview.  midsummer is not my favorite play. i like a good tragedy or a gritty history over comedy any day. i did however spend the entirety of my graduate career dissecting this play into its many parts and have always found productions to pale in comon to my own interpretation   all ego accounted for. the atmostheatre is set within five privately owned wooded acres and brags beauty around every mossy tree. but dont plan to sit back and relax for this nearly three hour adventure and dont wear your favorite shoes. you will be hiking from scene to scene one mile in total and although the hike is not rigorous be sure to have your legs about you for the rough terrain. id also advise you leave your bladder at the top of the hill as facilities are lacking down below. what is not lacking is creativity and ingenuity. sets range from small stages graced with afternoon tea to large tree stumps that serve as fairy soapboxes. fairy beds are made within the natural contours of the woods and rocks. every tree every stump sprig leaf branch ray or shadow sets the scene for mischief in the wood because all the wood is bousels stage. exits and entrances happen when and where you least expect them. you just may happen upon a sleeping  or as a scene engages front and center two lovers may be spied above lingering toward the stage. fairies may rush upon you as you hike along a small trail. and even when you arent being bum rushed during your trek your steps are guided by a melodic flutist amy manley drawing you toward the next scene of the play. gregorio de masis costume design and  daniels creature effects are impeccable. corseted fairies are smartly winged and seem to be adorned with only the elements of the wood rather than the usual synthetic sparkles. the purple horned  played by warden lawlor is a spirit of a different sort. short and stocky hairy and with a grumbly and unfortunately a sometimes too quick way of speaking lawlors  is far more fiendish than . in fact the one great deficiency of this play outside of an unsung lullaby is the overshadowed brawl between  jason peelle and  karen offereins and the consequential complete loss of motive for all the actions to come. the two stand on their tree stumps and politely argue during a mid hike interval but the lack of a changeling boy and a bit of mis staging leads one to focus more on the apple chomping ster than the fairy king and queen. peelle and offereins also play a sort of blasé bourgeois version of  and  which i found somewhat boring until i noted the definite contrast between the controlled athenian walls and the raw and volatile nature of the wood. peelles  is almost volcanic with a tendency to scream his orders in a psychotic versus authoritative manner. its a bit unsettling and one wonders how such a king could run his wooded kingdom but then again his house is not exactly in order is it? our fairy crossd lovers reign supreme almost from beginning to end achieving greatness upon entering the wood. kari wolman as  is a sassy spitfire properly cast as short in stature but great in spirit. both  and  wylie herman and spencer mccall respectively are appropriately interchangeable although mccall pulls a notable tom cruise as he leaps up onto a tree stump and with a widened gate declares his love for . through the consistently good acting and the very physical brawls and banters shines something great in molly benson as . benson adds another dimension to her character by including thought and contemplation in her words. she unfolds and grows as  and is an intelligent addition to the stage no matter how distraught her character may be over the idle love of her . more connection with her audience during her many soliloquies easily achievable through direct eye contact would serve her character well even so her knowledge of the language and fine performance cannot be denied. the action and interaction of the rude mechanicals proves somewhat uneven though entertaining.   bottom played by victor carrion aka the private owner of this five acres is best when he is under the wiles of the fairy queen or perhaps he is best when wearing the amazing skeletally constructed donkey head again ingeniously made from branches and other bits from the wood. their play within the play offers some twists and turns in both action and word permitting allison millers wall a more solid standing. after all due applause i stood and made my way back to my car   my ticket back into the city. hiking up the terrain i noticed something quite lovely my first smile after a production of a midsummer nights dream. i almost hate to say it but all ego aside i do believe i am transformed.,4,Comedy,Positive
Midsummer Night's Dream,Carolino's Midsummer Fantasies Require Some Shaping,Denise Battista,quirky yet creative director rey carolino enlists a full cast in this just over two hour production of a midsummer nights dream at san s phoenix theatre and like the bird this play rides the mythological roller coaster of crash and burnrise from the flames from beginning to end. i do have faith however that the ups and downs will teeter to a more steadily burning flame after a few previews and a few deep breaths on the actors parts. the plays fairy crossd lovers christina l. flynn and sung min park  and  along with livia demarchi and slightly less so michael dorado  and  are this plays breaths of fresh and vibrant air. flynn and park express obvious chemistry upon the stage and flynn and demarchi conduct their battles in an acrobatic wwf sort of fashion adorned with wit. our rude mechanicals are an interesting bunch headed by the frail yet funny stephen randolph as nick bottom. randolph is accompanied by a group of drunkards who mock rather than revere their pyramus in a surprising turn of events. their play within the play is a comedic joy to watch and i was left amazed by bottoms top of the line ass head labored over for months by none other than randolph and the papier mache lions costume created by scott ludwig. a seductive circle of fairies saunter across the stage in a pussycat dolls girl band sort of way teasing a sometimes too whiny sometimes sweetly intoxicating  luis garza. our curvaceous fairy dolls even sing a harmonious lullaby to their fairy queen.  played by the i believe russian yelena segal is sometimes difficult to understand although my ears adjusted to her accent before the play was over. speech is the troupes biggest impediment. even as lovely as it is to watch the darkly lined deep eyes of this plays  his strong presence is only felt in his silence. ludwig as well as the majority of the actors in this production speak their lines by rote sadly much in the way our mechanicals are criticized with the exclusion of our  and   and snug the joiner granted delara suanns part is small her words are well spoken. these fellows doth not stand upon points. they know not the stop. with the stop the ever debated comma or colon comes meaning and that meaning is lost in throes of memorization   memorization that lacks meaning.  is meaning. without the meaning   without the understanding   there is but airy nothing. opening preview jitters perhaps. id place a small wager on it. carolinos actors have but a short time to understand but with that comprehension i have no doubt they will apprehend their audience.,3,Comedy,Negative
Romeo & Juliet,A Beautiful Bard Ballet,Benjamin Alper,it is a testament to s enduring genius that his works have been translated not only into hundreds of languages but also across different artistic mediums. whether it be a traditional play an opera or some other type of production s dramatic brilliance still shines through. such is the case with the national ballet theatre of odessas recent production of  and  at the fox theatre. personally ballet is a difficult medium for me to understand and appreciate but having the ballet grounded in the most famous love story of all time certainly made the performance more accessible. once i got my head around who the different characters were it was easy to sit back and enjoy this beautiful and stunning performance. the ballet features the famous score written by sergei prokofiev and choreography by mikhail lavrovsky. prokofievs score alternates between light playful numbers that highlight the youthful vitality of the young lovers and dark dreadful numbers that underscore the ultimate tragedy of their love. lavroskys choreography was beautiful and the sword fighting scenes between the rival families in particular were executed flawlessly and with impressive precision. expansive scenery consisting of large backdrops of the verona hills or the garden outside s chamber instantly transported the audience to italy and also gave the cast of 55 dancers plenty of room to execute their intricate maneuvers. their beautiful costumes communicated to the audience the identity of each character and the faction they supported. lighting was used very effectively and changed with the tone of every scene to help enhance the power and beauty of their performances. the final scene of the ballet the deaths of the lovers was a tour de force. the anger rage and despair of first s death and then s was palpable   yet the heightened emotions in the scene did not render the dancers movements disordered or chaotic. it was truly reable to see the dancers manage to keep their movements so tight and elegant while still clearly conveying the passion and emotion in this scene. alternating in the title role of  are elena dobryanskaya and olga vorobyeva while  was alternated by sergey dotsenko and stanislav skrynnik skrynik in this production. mykola vorivodin in the part of  was impressive as his physical performance clearly embodied the cheekiness of the moody character without ever uttering a word. atlantas famous fox theatre is an excellent venue to see this type of performance. steeped in history the ornately decorated theatre with its large stage and multiple levels of seating assured that even those sitting far from the stage could observe and appreciate all of its beauty and complexity. even if you know nothing about ballet its impossible not to be impressed by all the performances in this production. the physical feats they routinely perform are truly a marvel as they gracefully fly across the stage. this along with the excellent pacing of the performance bring in a run time of around two hours capturing the entire story without dragging. while it is understandable that many unfamiliar with ballet might be reluctant to attend this production i strongly encourage everyone to see it.  has been interpreted and reinterpreted in so many different ways throughout history and every different iteration or production of a  play deepens our understanding of s works and his genius. with its beautiful score excellent dancing and stunning scenery the national ballet theatre of odessas production of  and  certainly continues this legacy. the national ballet theatre of odessa is currently on tour check your local listings ot ticketing websites like stubhub for their current schedule in your area. more information on the national ballet theatre of odessa is here,5,Tragedy,Positive
Romeo & Juliet,Surprises Keep Classic Love Story Fresh,Glenda Pearce,ask anyone what is the greatest and most well known love story ever told and theyll say  and . not only do we know the story we know from the prologue even as s audience did this is the fatal story of star cd lovers who do with their deaths bury their parents strife. one of the most performed  plays for over 400 years there are many inherent challenges in bringing the famous tragedy with a fresh perspective. thus the pop up globe has approached the summer season with a fresh angle by combining two contrasting plays with love themes at their heart into a season of love. artistic director dr. miles  and his team of creative experts discovered a way to bring new perspectives into these well known love stories by employing engaging delivery surprise elements structural originality and calculated audience response. and this unique company   the pop up globe northumberlands company of thirteen players   shows just what it was like in s time by performing in the space for which it was written. throughout the season the two love plays will alternate and a single cast will move between plays and a range of characters. the pace of the action is rapid. in  and  the prologue isnt even half delivered foreshadowing the outcome a clever touch just in case we dont want to know the ending before the warring street action and lively stage combat alexander holloway of the s and s rapidly thrusts us into the feud. we are immediately invested in finding out what will happen next. from this point forward the scenes effortlessly interweave and smoothly overlap in precisely timed episodes. this synonymous juxtaposition is effective as it reminds us of what is happening in the world of passionate love driven  darcy kent even as we see what is happening in the world of a young and innocent doll playing  jess hong. this heightens the intensity of the dramatic irony of emotional moments such as when we watch the soft intimacy of  and s marriage morning on the balcony already being threatened. below them the well meaning lord  stephen lovatt is promising to marry unsuspecting  to the gentle good looking teddy bear and flower carrying count  theo david on thursday next. the staging is imaginative with well anchored stage positions and makes use of all of s spaces. for instance the trapdoor becomes the vault through which the dead bodies of  and  are lowered ceremoniously in a stilled silence. furthermore a number of carefully orchestrated surprise elements are so adroitly interwoven that we are never able to anticipate what will happen next   keeping the audience entirely engaged and entertained.  has deliberately accessed the potential comic elements of the play and in doing so it significantly lightens the action of the first half. much of the comic action is delivered to the groundlings as it would have been in s time. superbly played the nurse amy usherwood has a lusty enthusiasm for life with comic panache compelling facial expressions and garrulous vocal delivery. she surprised and delighted us throughout the play. as the love story unfolds we see much youthful delight from  a little silliness many dance scenes well executed movement choreographed by brigid costello and musical interludes which add the to credibility of her character. the audience forgets the tragic outcome just for a while as we watch the famous balcony scene played out with a comic touch by kents . oer the course of the play he moves compellingly from a smitten lovelorn wreck to a natural love filled comic and determined impulsive lover then to a friend who will not let his friends life be taken without payback then on to a passionate lover and finally to a grief motivated husband no longer wishing to live without his love. other outstanding performances amongst a very talented cast come from  tom wingfield and larger than life  rutene spooner balancing the complexity of these characters. lord  stephen lovatt has his many sides captured with both depth and truth and we genuinely see his anger at s inexplicable refusal to marry  raising the emotional stakes. unexpected and innovative costume designs chantelle gerrard are part of the surprise. known for creating the spectacular chantelle has coordinated a superb range of creative angles such as the queen elizabeth look for the prince renee lyons and creative and surprising mardi gras twists for those attending the masked ball that contrast effectively against the beautiful detailed classical designs as well as the juxtaposition of the contemporary costumes for the street fighters. what makes any  production great is the directors ability to work with s text and his extraordinary ability to bring his characters to life by a simple turn of phrase a single breath a pause a look or the jokes they make. all of these are found in this production and judging by the reactions are undoubtedly appreciated by the audience. in an interview dr. miles  said he wanted to keep the audience aware that this was a story   a great love story. and it was re told with a new perspective employing surprise elements more comedy than usual creating structural originality and calculated audience response. dont miss the final season of the pop up globes summer of love. the popup globe company is now on the international circuit. the summer season runs december 13   march 1 auckland new zealand. ,4,Tragedy,Positive
Romeo & Juliet,Delaware Shakespeare Asks What’s in a Name,Jennifer Kramer,delaware s annual community tour returns for their fourth year with  and  . performed in various non theatrical spaces across the state their production offers an energetic take on the classic story and aims to make s work accessible to audiences of every kind. the community tour fits their production to whatever space they perform in by relying on a theatre in the round configuration and minimalist staging. sculptor phillip scarpone provides the set design with a few key pieces two irregularly shaped metal tables and a ladder. the ladder is primarily used for s infamous balcony the tables can be rotated on their sides or pushed together to create a platform giving each location its own distinct look with varying levels of abstraction. the sides of the tables are filled in with mesh and both they and the ladder are threaded with frayed ribbons and faded scraps of fabric like the remains of vines and creeping plants clinging to life as winter approaches. the blend of industrial and natural aesthetics is visually striking though its purpose in the overall production is unclear. costume designer lauren parrow provides interestingly relevant modern dress with distinct medieval and renaissance flavors.  and  in  blue both sport garments clearly reminiscent of a doublet over a gauze shirt  pairs street tough black with a red leather tunic  initially appears in a grey corset and gold overskirt over her beaded shift dress. other elements exist solely to provide visual flair and character details like lady s intimidating ruff of iridescent black feathers or the portentous prints of skeletal structure on s shirt. s outfit is particularly allusive. her fashionable grey sneakers speak to her youth her shift dress combines the maroon shades of her house with the light blue of s and she sheds her constricting corset between dancing with her father and partnering with  during the s feast. as the title characters wilfredo amill  and sol madariaga  excel at capturing the physicality of two teenagers in love. their first encounter is particularly well done the two pair off for a social dance and quickly evolve from mutual awkwardness to mutual enthusiasm to the point where  almost forgets the dance steps to try to follow  through a partner change. after several frustrations they are reunited and amill and madariaga suffuse their first words and first kiss with a charming mix of youthful eagerness and hesitance. amill makes for a particularly endearing  at his best when  is in love he bubbles over with energy dancing in place at the height of his happiness barely restraining himself from desperate action at his nadir and infusing his lines with plenty of passion. madariaga is equally sweet tempering s determined impetuousness with a relatable nervousness though this excellent physical performance is occasionally at odds with her more strident line delivery. the productions doubling means that the play is performed with just eight actors and the cast is uniformly strong.  konstantinidis showcases her range going from s predatory prowl to lady s caustic brittleness. tai verleys turn as the nurse offers a particularly well rounded portrayal whose humor is far more intentional leaning into her sharp almost cynical observations of others and emphasizing her motherly affection for . this makes their final scene together all the more devastating she finds and hides s incriminating vial and dagger and verley expertly portrays the mixture of grief regret and bitter responsibility at s apparent suicide. director lindsay smiling keeps the production moving at a steady pace aided by a thorough edit of the text. some of the plays notable lines fall victim to pruning for little apparent reason and a few exchanges are edited to the point of confusion but for the most part the changes work well   enhancing the productions alternate character interpretations as with the nurse or introducing more character continuity such as giving  s lines and duties in act v. the use of live music and sound effects from composermusician emily schuman provides additional depth to the production. smiling also takes an innovative approach to the fight scenes. instead of stage fighting which uses weapons that may or may not be allowed in their various venues fight choreographer jacqueline holloway delivers highly stylized conflicts where the actors use claves as weapons and watching characters get metaphorically brutalized by percussion instruments is surprisingly effective. one of the main thematic concerns of the production stated by smiling in his program notes and echoed by delaware s producing artistic director david stradley before the play is whats in a name?   how assumptions about names and labels can hinder communication and spark conflict while the willingness to reflect on and even abandon ones identifiers can lead to self actualization and freedom. at its heart delaware s  and  embraces the assumptions tied to its name delivering all the expected drama. however it is equally clear that these expectations have been fulfilled through a great deal of thought and creativity. what delaware  rejects is the assumption that  is only meant for certain audiences by offering a classic production that everyone can enjoy.,4,Tragedy,Positive
Romeo & Juliet,Good from Fair Use: The Wilma’s R&J,Jennifer Kramer,thanks to four centuries of popularity s plays have inspired any number of ambitious reimaginings some radical and thought provoking others more interested in their own cleverness than in the play itself. happily the wilma theaters production of  and  aligns itself with the first camp offering an energetic take on a transformed text that nevertheless retains the essential message of the play. the major themes director blanka zizka has chosen to highlight in the play are the youthful passion and drive of the characters and the walls both literal and metaphorical that stifle them. the latter feature prominently in matt saunders set design which perfectly evokes maximum ambience from minimalist dressing. an imposing golden twenty foot high industrial wall climbable by means of its piping and unusually graffitti free stretches along the back of the stage serving as the boundaries around the s home as well as the preferred hangout for veronas disaffected youth. interiors are suggested by rolling screens of gold fringe a particularly clever bit of staging that presents barriers to the characters without interfering with the audiences line of sight.  shaplins masterful lighting design suffuses the atmosphere with a similar golden glow but one that subtly evokes the midday glare of the desert or the dying rays of the sun. shaplin even manages to imbue the dawn with a distinct ominousness as the lights slowly come up on s seemingly lifeless corpse in iv.5. the overall effect transforms veronas opulence into a sterile and desolate wasteland. costume designer vasilija zivanic does an admirable job with modern dress that genuinely feels like it was pulled from the characters closets or off the laundry pile on the floor of their room depending on the character. the trendy horde of veronas youths leads toward artsy and extremely casual featuring everything from crop tops layered spaghetti strap dresses and overalls down to s plain white tee black cropped pants and sneakers.  sports a similar palette white sailor dress black leggings gold sneakers in an athleisure look that alludes to her familys more prep school values the older s along with the prince and  strictly stick to business formal in their pressed suits and ties or conservative dresses and towering heels. the cast pared down to a dozen characters though augmented by the chorus is consistently strong tackling an diction and modern dance moves with equal aplomb. taysha marie canales plays  with an almost palpable vitality expertly balancing her bubbly enthusiasm with a pragmatic drive. this is even more evident in its absence canales gives all s encounters with the elder s and  a quiet reserve a ed contrast to her warm and physically affectionate interactions with the nurse krista apple and  matteo scammell. scammell meanwhile has the difficult task of playing a melodramatic  without slipping into melodrama himself   something he does not always quite manage. however his chemistry with canales and with s friends kevin meehan as  and  martinez briggs as  is excellent and there is never any doubt of the strength and inescapable pull of s feelings. in her determination to approach  and  as a new work unburdened by centuries of tradition and interpretation director blanka zizkas most noticeable variation is a thorough edit of s text. archaic second person singular pronouns and obsolete vocabulary words have been swapped out for their modern equivalents and zizka has trimmed down dialogue scenes and entire plot threads. though noticeably emended what is fascinating about this process is how much remains in the play the story unsurprisingly does not change but character interactions the plays thematic content and the texts most famous speeches all keep their coherency and emotional resonance. a highlight is martinez briggs excellent take on s queen mab soliloquy the traditional introduction segues into a freestyle mashup of pop culture shoutouts drug references hip hop lyrics and beyoncé allusions that conveys the same frenetic energy and contemporary mythology as s lines did four hundred years ago. zizkas edits serve mostly to pare away layers and reveal the plays core. zizka accompanies this streamlined text with dynamic blocking and plenty of musical accompaniment. the plays chorus is realized rather more literally led by composer and music director gracie martin they perform original compositions that serve the same purpose of illuminating the plot and the characters states of mind while they simultaneously partake in the action as the young citizens of verona. many of these performances are incredibly effective martinez briggs opening rap the ominous chant of the plays keywords interspersed with hate and blood that precedes fight scenes martins indie folk ballad as interpretive dancers act out s longing and frustration in iii.2. however as the play progresses a few of the musical breaks begin to feel less necessary. the audience does not need martin repeatedly staring soulfully into the house or a lyrical spelling out of s many feelings when the production has already effectively conveyed its emotions with the acting and atmosphere. the incorporation of the chorus into the action also leads to some thematic dissonance at the plays conclusion. instead of having the adults resolve to end their feud at the discovery of   and  tragic fates the chorus expresses their disgust with all the violence and follows martins musical and physical lead to climb over walls instead of being trapped by them concluding the production by exhorting the youth of today to make the sometimes radical choice of love over hate. on its own its an inspiring rallying cry and a nicely topical political statement. however in this production the conflict has largely played out on a very personal level there is very little sense of the feud as a systemic problem consuming a new generation. combined with the reduced presence of the adult characters this places the majority of the violence at the hands of the chorus themselves and the production does not give them particular self awareness of their complicity. however this does not detract from the productions ambition nor make it any less visually and aurally arresting. the wilma theaters  and  marries the classic play with an unapologetically modern sensibility transforming its young protagonists passion for a better future of into hope for our own.,4,Tragedy,Positive
Romeo & Juliet,Romeo & Juliet: A Requiem,Jennifer Kramer,an order of the prince of verona the houses of  and  both alike in dignity do still disturb the quiet of our streets and for that offense on pain of death house of  and house of  shall be required to assemble in this public place all citizens of verona shall bear witness as they recount the tragic events of  and  these posted notices fill the box office gift shop and lobbies of peoples light and once the audience enters the theater they encounter the same proclamation in their playbills and towering over each end of the stage. director samantha reading and producing director zak berkman with help from visiting dramaturg geoff proehl have adapted s  and  into    a requiem a production for six actors in the roles of the survivors of the events of the play with the ambitious goal to serve as a mix of tribute retrospective and hopefully catharsis and redemption. set designer james f. pyne jr. does an excellent job of setting the stage both literally and metaphorically. constructed to form a perfect mirror image two sets of gently rising tiers on either side of a green sward  the tombs of the title characters flanked by heavy marble benches for contemplation. the hexagonal space contains most of the action and the bright lighting and greenery give it the bucolic atmosphere of a  in the park production. however the imposing monuments bearing the princes order loom at each end of the stage overshadowing the proceedings with purpose. costume designer marla jurglanis provides similarly well constructed work with deliberately era less dress. the s wear cool shades of navy and grey the s warm browns and reds but beneath these superficial difference their costumes are near mirrors of each other   the two feuding families are just as much alike as they are different. lords  and  have the most medieval outfits wearing long tunics and elaborate sword belts over brocaded shirts the ladies  and  meanwhile have hybrid gowns sixteenth century stomachers under a split overdress with high almost victorian collars. the nurse tends to the puritan with a linen cap and relatively simple brown dress over a fine silk shift and the friar rounds out the cast in a long black coat and cowl as equally appropriate for a cyberpunk as a seminarian. however over their own clothes the survivors must don the garments of their fallen families a dark green one shouldered cloak for  a golden jeweled capelet for  and red sash for  a dashing gold scarf for  and matching stole for . the cast is most effective when portraying the main action of  and . somewhat ironically teri lamm as the undead lady  adds the most life to the proceedings her rendition of  flings himself to the ground beneath s window in the throes of love and her version of  captures both the uncertainty and the strength of character beyond her years. stephen novelli as lord  also has a brief turn as  in the masquerade an adept portrayal of teenage excitement beneath the audiences snickering before capturing s stentorian rejection of her in act iii scene 5. each member of the cast adds some skillful details of characterization to the production   brian  wilson lord  portraying  with both gravitas and tenderness graham smith a fiery  by way of the friar marcia saunders hitting the perfect balance of the nurses scatterbrained affection jeanne sakata giving lady  an eloquent grief   but the sum is at times less than its parts. the presentation of the adults own personalities when they are not re enacting the personalities of the lost generation is sadly elusive and the decision to have most of the cast quietly standing around watching the action adds an artificial distance to the proceedings. the production centers around the concept of a requiem as both memory and memorial but unfortunately the justification for this frame device never quite becomes clear. presumably the adults of verona are supposed to confront their culpability in the childrens deaths but nearly all references to the feud itself are cut which means the attitudes and behaviors that pushed their children to such extremes are never addressed or repudiated. likewise absent is the reconciliation between lords  and  in the penultimate lines of s text offering the grim implication that this cycle of reenacting their childrens last days may continue on forever   even beyond the grave if lady s presence is anything to go by. however reading and berkmans conceit is quite intriguing and the production itself has many deft touches from the well chosen garments of  and  and their peers to the small flower from friar laurences soliloquy transforming into s sedative and s poison to lamms lady  sitting like patience on a monument well before the play starts until revealing herself at her leisure to her husbands and fellow citizens understandable if reably restrained amazement. readings melding of certain sections of the play such as intercutting s death with her pledges of love in act ii scene 2 highlight interesting parallels and the selection of the twenty one scenes portray the meat of the story under her able direction. the story of  and  themselves is well played. it is easy to see the allure of reading and berkmans transformative work. reordering the play allows new light to be shed on smaller moments. veteran an actors revisiting roles usually cast with their younger counterparts allows for new interpretations born out of their experiences. and in a time when the news cycles are filled with tragic losses showing characters reacting to one of the most famous fictional tragedies mourning and coming to terms with their grief and guilt provides the hope that our society is capable of similar reflection. peoples lights production of    a requiem offers a new perspective on the classic by showing the characters themselves experiencing it and thereby making it more present to our own experience.,4,Tragedy,Positive
Romeo & Juliet,Capturing Modern Day Youth in Romeo and Juliet ,Yuko Kurahashi,the  theatres production of  and  staged at the lansburgh theatre illuminates the actions of youth with irrepressible energy emotion and passion which result in multiple deaths. set in a contemporary time and location young people from the  and  families clash over turf much like in the 1950s musical west side story also inspired by s  and . throughout the performance the audience witnesses verbal and physical fights between the two families. like the film this productions multiracial casting evokes a lower manhattan atmosphere. the reflection of todays youth and their culture in this production by a dc theatre company is not coincident. in the program note director alan paul states he wanted teenagers to walk into the theatre and see people that look and dress like them and have the experience of being a teenager and to understand and explore the anxieties and thrills of being young. however what is lacking in the production is the ramifications of the history of animosity between the families that must have dictated the lives of those involved. some hints of how the two wealthy families surrounded by their bodyguards have shaped the politics of the city and its residents would have made the  theatre companys contemporary style presentation more convincing. in jeans t shirts hoodies varsity jackets tank tops short pants sneakers and sunglasses the characters of family friends and servants of the s and s seem to be free from the webs of their family and city politics.  veenstra as  and ayana workman as  with their contemporary mannerisms and in casual clothes also seem free from the restrictions and control of parents and their politics. the famous balcony scene takes place in the  dining room insinuating that  can walk around the house in her tank top and pants late at night. if the climate is that free and open the audience may ask what prevents  and  from eloping? the prologue is delivered by shravan amin in jeans a t shirt and a baseball cap vacuuming the floor as he apparently listens to his ipod in his pocket so we dont see it. his presence as a twenty first century youth and his lines about a pair of star crossd lovers who emerge from ancient grudge and the fatal loins of these two foes are a bit unconvincing. dane laffreys monumental architectural red two story set serves as a bar the s home a church the streets and the tomb. however laffreys scenography alludes so much to the s home that it is unable to suggest the multiple scenes over the course of s text. in this production the first fight between the servants of the two families s and s takes place in a bar frequented by both. the following scenes of a feast at the s and later a sanctuary in the church also use the same box set. as a result every location appears to take place in the  house. despite this an intriguing component of laffreys design is a huge box at the center that served as a dj box an altar and a bedroom by changing its level of transparency and reflection.  ayana workman in a tank top and pajama pants acts like a privileged and spoiled teenager but speaks like a well read poet reflecting the characters innocence and intelligence.  veenstra portrays a likable idealist  with high libido. jeffrey carlsons  contrasts veenstra by portraying a cynical yet loyal friend of . keith hamilton cobb as  and judith lightfoot clarke as lady  portray a disconnected couple. emily townley as s nurse normally played by inga ballard underscores the characters peppiness wittiness and infusiveness. because of their contemporary clothes class distinction is erased and townleys nurse in capri pants and bright dress shirt looks and acts like s favorite auntie. bright and somber lights contrast the stage in an attempt by lighting designer jen schrievner to juxtapose scenes such as the  feast and a sanctuary in the church . yet a red box set that suggests the s power dominates throughout the show and makes the differences between locations a bit obscure. while kaye voyces costume design with modern day clothes often made the characters positions unclear her costumes at the  ball are exuberant. in their fabulous ballroom dresses and modified tuxedos they dance to pop music prepared by sound designer daniel kluger. setting  in twenty first century united states is extremely challenging because we do not live under the same kind of rules cultural mores and social values and expectations. it is difficult to convince the audience that the characters of our high tech age would make the same choices that  and  made in their renaissance time. in spite of the productions shortcomings i commend the directors attempt to encourage young audiences to relate to the story and characters as well as to use them to reflect on problems such as violence and drugs.,4,Tragedy,Positive
All's Well That Ends Well,Here’s to My Love: Talent and Promise Abound in “Star Crossed Lovers”,Robert M. LoAlbo,if you were to take s ten tragedies randomly in hand and attempt to order them in terms of the maturity levels of characters and plot you most likely would end up putting them in the same order in which they were written thus reflecting s growth as a writer. hence his later tragedies like king lear and coriolanus are plays that tend to work like a well matched professional chess game with players skillfully posturing and jockeying for position. these later plays contain fully realized characters and carefully plotted events albeit with a tone that shows a growing distaste for the world. as such his earlier works tend to play out with characters that lack development ones who make rash short sighted decisions along with a plot that hinges on coincidence and happenstance all of which reveal a naïveté usually connected to youth. so  and  s second attempt at tragedy tends to lack the sophistication and satisfaction that accompanies iagos devious plotting or s ominous rise to power. the lovers of rj are too impulsive in their devotion to each other the friars hasty actions in the name of love too frustrating and the final moments played out too conveniently or inconveniently to suggest polished writing. its the  of a talented playwright just starting out. yes there are a number of iconic scenes and yes  and  and memorably fond characters but on the whole its number of issues often times outweigh the desired impact. the play also seems to be wildly popular. even today with a recent broadway production starring  bloom kenneth branaghs current london stage and filmed production an upcoming television series sequel and now francesco nuzzis star cd lovers the public is still clamoring for more. maybe its 9th grade english nostalgia when our 14 year old selves first experienced  and our maturity level found a kindred soul in one of the two titular characters. or maybe the rest of the world desperately holds onto the possibility of true love and those of us the anti friar s i suppose who become more jaded with young passionate love are growing fewer in number. either way its the play that just wont die and like a young  with lots of savvy and little experience nuzzis first film reveals a talent who shows great promise and deserves more opportunities to grow and mature as a filmmaker and a storyteller. with sensible self awareness in choosing  and  as the basis for his first film the plays simplistic love story easy to handle plot twists and sometimes too thin characters provide a good foundation for a beginning filmmaker. however not satisfied in directing a faithful adaptation or maybe not budgeted to nuzzi sets his story in fair new jersey drawing from the garden states more known and sometimes more infamous qualities. in a modern setting with its densely populated housing and well manicured lawns nuzzi films in close pre fab housing quarters making his film a middle class cousin of joss whedons much ado about nothing. the directors choice in actors also reflects that nj sensibility. with gelled up pompadours thick gold chains and ray bans that only jersey could get away with our  and his friends are natives.  evangelistas northern jersey ethnic look with his dark hair tight white shirt arm bandana and gold catholic pendant contrasts well with lauren muraskis southern jersey shore belle  with her lighter complexion blonde hair soft features and ralph lauren pastel wardrobe. its a jersey shore match made in heaven and nuzzis purposeful choices extend beyond the sometimes stereotypical giving additional depth to well known conflict. his decision to put  and  both in the armed forces but have them at the opposite ends of the spectrum helps effectively further define the dynamic between the two. s controlling ptsd and plain fatigues that show a lack of significant rank most likely choosing a life filled with buffoonery and keg stands over advancement contrast well with s high ranking military bars with probably no wartime experience and gung ho attitude. the added dynamic of jealousy and disrespect develop the already flickering tension between the two and the payoff is that much more effective in their confrontation. director nuzzi plays it mostly straight without diverting from most accepted productions too much but the small choices that are made to update the film distinguish it from others. with a handheld camera the sometimes shaky feel contributes to the comfortable natural setting as if we are spying on our neighbors intimate conversations. when filled with potentially explosive energy director of photography  hedlund displays a deft confidence with camera movement as it thrillingly swoops through these moments of intensity and violence capturing just the right angle or lighting with just the right hue. viewers feel as if we are watching things we shouldnt intimacy not intended for our senses making guarded moments that much more private. nuzzi inserts technology use as expected where he can as prince  watches fight security footage  stops  and  mid confessional to take a selfie and  gets set up to marry  in an iphone conference call. its a clever addition that might be proven more so with a greater consistency as we wonder when  decides to fake her own death why didnt she just text  the details? with any production of rj most directors know that their  can make or break the show despite having fewer lines than . whereas  is all puppy eyed melancholy and swooning  is a rag doll of emotions torn between a number of forces and wills. she is manipulated won over lost crushed outraged and secretive. baz luhrmann must have known that fact as the magnificent claire danes is head and shoulders above a stiff and awkward leonardo dicaprio. so here although evangelista is a capable  its muraski with whom we cant take our eyes off. her subtle glances tender motions and loving gazes are gently juxtaposed with her teary laments of misfortune and outright terror to her fathers threats. moreover her skillful nuances and approaches steadily develop and solidify every one of her scenes as they play out. at first the initial meet of  and  lacks the necessary sparks to convince the audience of their love at first sight attraction but through practiced interaction and an attention to each others acting strengths by the time they are pledging devotion to each other seemingly moments later on the balcony the heat has been turned up and the chemistry has clicked. nuzzis reliance on his actors for primary audience engagement proves to be a wise decision. there are astute small business choices throughout as actors add to the scene with small but character defining actions  gluttonously stuffs his face in front of lord  at his party county  gets his hand slapped by a servant when reaching for an apple before its served  and  offer cigars to lord  to win his favor and entrance to his party and lord  proudly presents a suckling pig to his party guests. these choices from the director and the actors are what emotionally connect us to these characters helping us to cherish them and care about their fates and have us wishing for more especially in the latter acts. but its also choices like these that reveal a game cast ready for anything. standouts include greg jolley as lord  with his large thick presence at once displaying empathy and comradery which turns to frightening menace as he berates and threatens with an undertone of violence. many times in the script jolley could easily have slipped into caricature that lacks dimensionality but he deftly keeps the portrayal human and heartfelt you end up feeling sorry for him where other productions tend to vilify him. ted wrigleys friar  emotes gray haired wisdom and hope especially when he has to talk  down from killing himself. wrigleys portrayal is wrought with shock and surprise tinged with outrage and his quick verbal delivery shows a familiar ease and skill with the language. melissa harlows nurse although a bit too sassy and screechy at times understands well the crassness of the character and manages to deliver strong emotion in her quieter moments while emily s as benvolia displays possibly the most natural affect of the bunch but her character is regulated to a handful of scenes and disappears much too quickly. despite some minor technical issues and the occasional wane like a young  nuzzi and hedlund show good raw talent and a keen eye displaying a true love for the material and their cast members. given the more than modest budget of 15000 nuzzi is able to accomplish much most likely through favors from family and friends. thankfully he doesnt betray their confidence and makes good on promises made mostly likely and hopefully earning him future favors from the same people. and if so those future efforts may end up standing in the pantheon of seminal an productions. until then accomplished and resourceful star cd lovers may not be a main entrée at the  and  feast but its a tasty appetizer a nice entry point for budding  enthusiasts and a possible addition to next years 9th grade new jersey english curriculum.

Romeo & Juliet,TSU's Romeo and Juliet: Death Hovers over Verona,Michael Meigs,theres this dreamy romantic notion about  and  one that doesnt get much farther than the  garden the balcony and the flattered surprise of sweet  when her longed for dreamboat comes scrambling out of the darkness. innocence joined with ardor two almost grownups taking their love lives in hand and pledging them to one another. sigh. but theres also the truth of the facebook meme about rj being the story of two teenagers whose duplicity results in six deaths including their own. denis de rougements classic essay love in the western world traced the intertwining of the themes of love and death throughout western literature. love is so powerful so overwhelming that the little deaths of passion stimulate the legends of doomed lovers who reach the sublime only through their own destruction. this romantic drama of  so beloved of high school english teachers lays down exactly that correspondence and all too often the readers and spectators devote themselves exclusively to the lovers and rue their bad luck and missed opportunity.    at texas state doesnt neglect those vulnerable and impulsive youngsters. grayson yockey as  has the boundless energy surging emotions and determination of any gifted but inexperienced young man in love. slim chandler lovelle with her long red tresses is a lovely incarnation of the almost woman  fourteen years old but fresh and ripe ready to dupe anyone in her obstination to obtain the object of her desire. director amelia bahr gives us the presence of death from the first moment. as the lights come up the stage is filled with a tableau of dead bodies. as a silent hooded feminine figure abba yzeke observes the scene from on high and glides toward the immobile groupings conjuring them one by one to rise and go. throughout the play yzeke will move to join the actors at crucial moments. shes present but unseen at each slaying holding a deadly comforting hand to a torso or a face moving in balletic arc to accompany a fall. she disappears into the shadows from time to time. but its evident that she has foreknowledge of the grim outcome. the program for this production features a coherent and well reasoned commentary from bahr on this concept see link below. the director and a cast of articulate actors mostly undergraduates populate a fully realized society with vivid personalities. this  and  is more muscular exciting and full of conflict than other stagings ive seen. the reworking of the texas state mainstage theatre reinforces those aspects of the piece. with the opening of the nearby patti strickel harrison stage a couple of years ago suddenly the theatre buildings spacious amphitheatre with its sweeping rows of seats became superannuated. the university reworked the performing space by forgetting about former seating areas and turning the buildings deep backstage area into a floor level thrust stage with ranks of stadium seating on three sides. now instead of watching stage action as if through a telescope the audience is close up and face to face with the players. theres a two story platform at deep stage center in this production but the action surges regularly across the playing area. bounding roisterers take the sets steep staircase in both directions. actors move freely up the center aisle of each of the three audience sections address spectators directly and wiggle up over and across the gateway positioned across the down stage left entrance despite the comic detail on opening night that the swinging gate was clearly not latched. the whole cast exudes confidence both of language and of movement.  and  males are evenly matched and yockey kurt engh as  and  mcvay as  could easily have traded any of those three key roles among them. spencer hansen as serving man  opens as a sly prologue courting the audience quick to cry shame when a mobile phone interrupted his miming and declaiming that rogue ring came so aptly and so quick that one might suspect it had been planted. daniel mcgowan as  is lively unkempt and provocative looking a bit like zonker from doonesberry high on meth. junior gomez as county  eager formal suitor to  stumbles unsuspecting into a trap not of his own making.  minor deserves credit for much of the grounding of this action. not only for his fight choreography breathtaking in individual bouts and electrifying in the surge and clash of group struggles but also for his creation of lord  as both a general and a gentleman. this  does not dissuade  from challenging  at the masked ball he overmasters the hothead while continuing his role as genial host to the others. as the party ends lord  is clearly inebriated but still very much in control. and minor is so fierce in his scenes with the recalcitrant  that he vibrates with outrage and incipient violence. jordan puhala as lady  is an equally strong presence but hers is a strength of character rather than muscle. the use of relatively young actors in other traditionally senior roles is almost unavoidable since this is a university setting but director bahrs choices and interpretations are assured. danielle grisko as  the ruling prince is imposing and aristocratic with no need of advanced years. madelyn wright as the nurse employs no elaborate makeup to age using words and gestures instead to create that jolly indulgent character. friar  traditionally presented as something of an aged cloister rat becomes in c.k. andersons interpretation an earnest but unguided co conspirator of few more years than the protagonists hes seeking to help. this justifies the evident bonds between them and it goes some way to explain the good friars berating of despairing . yockey wails twisting in a huddle on the floor as agitated as a beaten child anderson screams his lines battering his way past s wordless distress into his charges consciousness. the friars stratagem fails when his messenger friar  joseph paz is quarantined because of explosure to plague leaving the banishéd  with no knowledge of the holy mans duplicity and his lies to the s. although theres no hint of it in the text or in this interpretation isnt this a moment of divine intervention? one challenge in  and  is to determine who is ultimately responsible for the lovers suicides theyre mortal sins remember that will forbid burial in holy ground and condemn them both to perdition. friar  bears much blame. in this production we readily understand that his errors and offenses dont come from mere foolishness. like those of the lovers they arise from youth and the insistent arrogance of inexperience. the friars confession to the prince explains the events but does nothing to absolve him of his own mortal sin. theres plenty of blame to go around. the princes rebuke of the heads of family prompts them to pledge to put up statues of gold over the lovers graves. the new peace between the clans is but a hollow achievement however deaths and suicides have left them almost without the capacity to quarrel further. bonus material click to view the program for  and

Romeo & Juliet,Experimental but Accessible Romeo and Juliet,Jennifer Kramer,the quintessence theatres production of  and  is almost uniquely suited to its venue. staged in the converted lobby of the historic sedgwick theater in mt. airy philadelphia one must first walk through the new lobby decorated with chalkboard illustrations of the current season a wide hall with soaring ceilings and enormous cracked mirror panels where preparations for the opening night celebrations are neatly screened off from the traces of the ongoing renovations the actual backstage and finally the distinctive art deco archways that lead into the performance space flanking the thrust stage and answering any lingering questions about what would happen if you cd a black box theater with an ancient egyptian tomb. the inheritance of history coincides with modern creativity and proves to be an excellent introduction for the quintessence theatres transformative  and . the set design by director alexander burns is deliberately restrained the black stage and backdrop directing the focus to the sets statement piece twin banks of old television monitors that display each scenes location broadcast the fight scenes in real time and provide the occasional visual effects dance party screensavers the pattern of moonlight on leaves blood spatters  the larger thematic purpose of these monitors is rather mysterious but there is no question that they add an unsettling tone to the production undersg the action with the atmospheric glow of their screens and the dispassionate cyberpunk gaze of obsolete technology. jane casanaves costume design meanwhile loosely alludes to the mid twentieth century like a less technicolor version of west side story. the men mostly wear suits or sport coats the women day dresses and cardigans. colors are muted but not absent with the sparkling reds and golds of the party crashers masks the bright blue of s skinny tie s white trimmed aquamarine dress with matching white sweater. conformity to the period is not particularly strict but occasionally it is a little too on the nose it seems dreadfully convenient that  and  just happen to turn up for their fight scene dressed in black jeans and leather greaser jackets. unlike many other experimental stagings of s work the actors adopt a more naturalistic style that keeps the production grounded even when more stylized elements are attempted. as the eponymous lovers both connor hammond and emiley kiser strike a delicate balance between mouthpiece for an epic romance and overdramatic teenager for the most part their youthful performances manage to convey the all consuming intensity of  and s passion without losing the charm and humor of teenaged excess. they are supported in this regard by the rest of the cast who react much as one might expect to such frequent outpourings of emotion. e. ashley izard as the nurse splits her time between hilariously un self conscious earthiness and a pragmatic disregard for the extremes of s temperament all without ever losing a genuine affection for her charge. jahzeer terrell and alan brincks portray s companions as his near foils terrells even keeled  endures his friends shenanigans with patience while brincks  reacts just as strongly as  but with a more cynical and deliberately performative edge. in a particularly hilarious moment brincks has  get so involved in the dramatics of his queen mab speech that even the ever dramatic  starts looking askance. josh carpenter shows friar laurence becoming increasingly overwhelmed by the strength of his young friends feelings he evolves from a long suffering fondness to an exasperation that provokes even a religious man to spit his oaths like a string of profanities to a near panic as he attempts to find a non suicidal solution for . the cast has excellent chemistry which makes it wholly believable that when deprived of their more level headed support system  exiled from his friends and any news of their plans and  abandoned by her parental figures as they attempt to sacrifice her to their whims spiral into self destruction. in addition to the tv monitors burns continues the anachronistic technological theme with electronic music by composersound designer steven cahill and impressive array of lighting effects by lighting designer david sexton. the action is underscored by an unsettling soundtrack   sometimes a little too obviously with the chorus already revealing the ending to play up front it seems unnecessary to accompany every instance of foreshadowing with a scare chord. the s masquerade is transformed into a rave the partygoers moving in intriguing patterns that mix modern and court dances.  and s first meeting takes place in a stylized sequence where spotlights pick them out from the confusion of the party as their dance partners combine in formation to lift them both in the air. like the tv monitors the effect is quite visually striking but it is difficult to determine the larger thematic significance of these flourishes the music and visuals are divorced from the rest of the setting and the production makes no comment on modern technology. however burns does offer an intriguing treatment of the plays text. the play is tightly edited with minor characters combined and wholes scenes skipped act i scene 1 once again falls prey to omission or streamlined. but burns goes a step further staging several scenes together simultaneously in triptychs and diptychs. the actors for each scene have their own distinctive space on stage and in dialogue even as their lines and blocking weave together and play off each other in an innovative transformative interpretation. it is a technique that depends on the audiences familiarity with the play but it offers a fascinating look into the connections and parallels within s writing. though the productions various threads of imaginative potential dont quite come together as a cohesive whole each individual part is entertaining and well executed. the quintessence theatres production of  and  shows that by drawing on and combining varied aesthetic influences even one of s most well known plays can be a source of new enlightenment.,4,Tragedy,Positive
Romeo & Juliet,Because It Is the Right Thing To Do,Kurt Daw,the artistic director of the san   festival rebecca j. ennals is leading the charge to broaden onstage opportunity in the bay area. her democratizing impulses are prominently on display in her production of  and  now touring local parks. in addition to featuring actors of color in close to half of the named roles the production also achieves gender parity by casting actresses in a number of roles that are gendered male. more subtly the cast also blurs the usually sharp distinction between character actors and leading actors by utilizing a wide variety of body and voice types in unexpected places. improving access onstage is a logical extension of the festivals mission of offering free  in the park along the joe papp model to a broad spectrum of community audiences. the performances are enormously popular playing to large crowds at all four of the bay area parks in which performances are held over the course of the summer. interestingly the much improved diversity is not directly featured as an artistic statement about rj at all. it is generally treated as invisible in this production. or should we say transparent? that  is a fairly conventionally cast white male who is convincing as a juvenile while  is played by a powerful african american leading lady rather than an ingénue is not foregrounded in any way. no west side story style explanations for the feud here. that  is played by the obviously female carla pantoja albeit with a false beard to spell out the gender of the character is just a matter to be taken in stride. she neither makes great effort to hide her underlying gender nor to use it to comment on the mindset of the man she is playing. regina morones  is more masculine in execution but neither her ethnicity nor actual gender is disguised. if any political point is made by these decisions it seems to be that in an ideal world they should not matter so very much   and for the most part the production upholds this viewpoint. it is successful as a narrative in which we look through gender ethnicity and even the actors types to see the raw story. often the surface appearances are contradicting or complicating what we see onstage but the production offers no consistent viewpoint from that effect. the only convention employed is that we as audience are expected to look through the specific representations to a universal theme. it is an interesting and admirable experiment. similar efforts are going on in many bay area  festivals this summer. california  festival known locally as calshakes produced an almost all female twelfth night earlier this season in which the actresses quite pointedly sometimes with hilarious crudity commented on their male personas. the sacramento  festival produced an original practices thus all male  and  and then balanced it with an all female as you like it. santa cruz  meanwhile is pursuing gender parity in its productions of much ado about nothing and  by changing the gender of characters along with all references to their gender in the texts. in these contrasting examples the diversity issues are carefully contextualized. although i prefer this approach ennals choices are interesting precisely because she offers no internal explanations. the effect is sometimes distracting i overheard quite a few confused murmurs from nearby audience members but the crowd eventually accepted that the casting was both color  and gender blind and stopped trying to read anything more into it. the stage reflected the diversity of the audience which was the message the quality of the performance is uneven but not because of anything having to do with the diversity choices. the scene painting is amateurish and ashley holvicks costumes although much better executed are conventional. ennals staging is frequently messy and occasionally just odd. the morning after scene for example is played on stage level so the balcony less  is forced to jump down into the crowd in order to have any sort of descent. the extensive doubling is successful although at one point it becomes logistically complicated phil lowerys friar laurence having to be onstage in the final scene means that his lord  cannot be. in the only significant rewriting therefore lady  appears onstage in the final scene as peacemaker after the surprising news to those that know the show well that her husband has just died. the roles of  and  are compellingly portrayed by carl holvick and lauren spencer respectively. their chemistry and energy are engaging. spencers  is more mature from the outset than any i have seen in years but she is more effective in the last half of the show than most because she is not childish and she clearly understands the choices she is making. it is actually kind of refreshing for once not to have to focus so hard on overcoming the inherent creepiness of men drooling over a thirteen year old. gwen loeb is wonderfully loud and bawdy as s nurse and in a doubling returns as the usually absent lady  for the final scene taking over all of her husbands traditional lines. phil lowerys friar laurence is earnest at every turn and more sympathetic than usual. mohammed shehata is a powerful prince  and is unrecognizable in his doubling as  which speaks to his versatility. the rest of the cast is serviceable without anyone standing out in either good or bad ways. the show features two very surprising and i think less than successful choices of convention in the first whenever the play features a rhyming couplet with an historic rhyme that is one where the words once rhymed but because of pronunciation changes no longer do such as loveprove or dieremedy the original pronunciation of one or both is restored to regain the rhyme. that is actually fascinating but certainly seems odd when numerous other original pronunciation issues such as preservation of puns or scansion are ignored. the second is that after the epilogue a traditional jig is performed by the full cast as the curtain call. it is not quite historically correct as original practice as such jigs were separate entertainments usually with risqué lyrics to songs in addition to the dancing in s time and not curtain calls. it was also not quite effective on its own terms since it broke the somber mode without transition or explanation. in these cases the lack of contextualization which worked for the casting was problematic. as of this writing the show has finished its run in pleasanton and cupertino. it plays saturdays and sundays in redwood city through august 23rd moves to the presidio in san  through september 13th and finishes its run at mclaren park in sf on september 27th.,3,Tragedy,Negative
Romeo & Juliet,Mercutio and Benvolio as Star-crossed Lovers: Who Knew?,Diana Louise Carter,the first half of  in delaware parks  and  ends with a tour de force sword fight. after many near misses  fiercely played by mary beth lacki sneaks in a death blow to the ever merry and lascivious  nick gerwitz. then the outraged  jonas barranca has a muscular brawl with  finally wrestling her to the ground and stabbing her again and again as she cries out in agony. by then the skills of fight choreographer steve vaughn and the actors have been amply displayed. the audience is aghast at the violence wrought by feuding families. but director tom loughlin delivers another direct hit departing from the bards text he has s best friend and moral conscience  marie hasselback costa survey the carnage and decide to slit her own throat. she falls next to her comrade and lover the slain . loughlins dramatic stopping point in this buffalo ny production foreshadows the lovers tragic ending. but unfortunately its also the most riveting part of the play. the production is entertaining and full of angst as it should be. but its also full of distractions that sometimes prove more engaging than the original storyline and therefore pulls the emotional punch that this tragedy should deliver. loughlin choses to portray  and  as a man and woman who cant keep their hands off each other instead of as two loyal ribald male friends. gerwitz and hasselback costa make the characters sizzle with sexuality bravado and athleticism causing the audience to invest great mental energy in that relationship. so when the pair disappears at intermission the audience isnt sure where to look. whiny love struck adolescents hardly seem attractive by comon. barranca plays the dreamboat  well and is appropriately ruled by his outsized emotions. smitten by infatuation for  hes languid. upon meeting  hes energized. possessing great hair and biceps barranca climbs part way up the balcony using only his arms at first. you cant mistake his eagerness to join his new lover. when he learns hes been banished from verona because of s death he sobs through the speech in which he laments that a fly has the freedom to land on s hand while he is forbidden to touch that hand. theres something amiss with  though. kathleen denecke is pretty and articulate has great comic timing and showcases s ricocheting feelings. but she plays  with too much gravitas forgetting the childish giddiness a 13 year old would experience upon falling in love. while one might argue with loughlins choice to elevate  and  two other staging decisions were perfect. s and s first encounter at the  ball happens on a lower step of the stage while ensemble members matt dellolio and lauren obrien perform a tender ballet duet on the main level of the stage. all the characters except  and  are watching the dancers oblivious to the fireworks igniting in the young couple. suddenly though you see the moment when only s nurse switches her attention from the dancers to her charge too late to stop her from falling in love. later when the lovers meet secretly and pledge their love the actors move onto the grass within arms reach of the audience bringing the theater goers into their intimacy.  starts out on the balcony but that feature of the set ends up being a mere metaphor rather than a true impediment. many of the minor roles are executed well enough to nearly steal the show. saul elkin who founded the company 40 years ago and remains its artistic director brings considerable experience and warmth to the role of friar laurence. part nurturing father figure part match maker his friar is the comfortable counter point to the imperious lords and ladies  and . its hard to imagine a more mellifluous voice than elkins and its understandable that he is the one to utter the chorus prologue. another veteran eileen dugan plays a delightful nurse going on and on and on and on with her stories seeming to gain energy with each turn of phrase even as she drains energy from her on stage listeners. the costumes in this production are a distraction. they seem to be a mishmash of contemporary renaissance influenced garments and fitness wear ordered from a number of popular catalogues. costume designer ken shaw has chosen a mostly grey black and white palette that harkens the somber grey and black set design by nathan elsener. but there are touches of brilliant   even neon   color that dont communicate anything understandable.  stands out in purple but then she disguises herself in a bright teal hoodie adorned with flowers to visit the monastery in a suicidal mood. huh? most confusing is   wrath. written as a credible suitor in this production his actions and dress paint him as an effeminate doofus. shaw clothes him in a short sleeved tan hoodie and black lycra gauntlets from wrist to mid bicep with an olive green kilt over compression capris. his formal wear is a green vest added to this weird ensemble.  meanwhile speaks in a reedy voice and fights as awkwardly as he dresses. as concerned about status as the s are its hard to imagine theyd choose a suitor who dressed and handles a sword this poorly. in all buffalos  and  isnt too bad way to spend a summer evening but it may prove a bit disappointing for the serious  fan.,3,Tragedy,Negative
Romeo & Juliet,Show Us Your Love,Jennifer Kramer,in popular consciousness the position that  and  occupies is one of extremes. its arguably s most famous play with only  for competition and the feud between the s and the s embodies the archetype of senseless violence even as the title characters relationship is touted as the romantic ideal. however the events of the tragedy are not enacted by larger than life heroes or dastardly villains but by characters who are amazingly human. the philadelphia  theatres production of  and  focuses on the characters as normal people and in doing so brings out the complexities elevate a familiar tale into an enduring cultural presence. the costume design by vickie esposito is an ahistorical mix of modern dress and elizabethan props and weaponry highlighting the plays resonance in any era. esposito also adds an element of metatheatricality  attends the masquerade as essentially herself wearing a medieval gown highly reminiscent of the characters traditional costume while the feud is literally reduced to black s and white  even as the action makes it clear this is far from the case. dirk duttes scenic design also evokes the thematic center of the production. the focus is the enormous backing wall and its balcony immediately recalling the plays most well known love scene while the lower half consists of chain link fences used to separate and imprison the characters. meanwhile the primary media of concrete and steel that speak to the plays themes of violence and captivity are rendered into stately walls covered in floral carvings and vibrant red girders or ornamental metal screens demonstrating that beauty can be created even under dire conditions. however this structure is just as clearly a façade over uncut stone and at the plays climax backlighting reveals that it houses the tomb of the s filled with skeletal remains and ancient weaponry a silent testimony to the dark history of conflict underlying the veneer of civilization. the actors excellent performances deliberately delve into this complexity particularly demonstrated by the way the supporting casts portrayals emphasize the humanity of their characters. j.j. van name adds an undercurrent of shrewdness to the nurses loving buffoonery her immediate recognition and rejection of  and her attempts to cajole  into a less problematic marriage suggest a nascent political instinct that rounds out her motherly instincts and tendency towards the ridiculous. james tolbert plays the friar as a man torn between his desire to help   end the feud deliver  to safety rescue  from an unwanted marriage   and his utter lack of preparation for confronting the sheer number of challenges suddenly heaped upon his head. even the portrayal of lord and lady  kevin bergen and caroline crocker respectively steers away from emphasizing their antagonism in favor of their relationships close with each other somewhat awkwardly distant with  and familial pride. bergen and crocker show the s with a real sense of accomplishment in presenting their daughter hosting their party and arranging a brilliant match between  and . when tragedy strikes with the death of  they fall back on this desire to control what they can their forcing  into marriage is part of their desperate scramble to regain their equanimity. a common theme runs through the casts performances uniting characters of all bloodlines and classes their baffled reactions to the many dramas of  and . director david oconnor states that he is trying to emphasize the sense of alienation brought about by falling in love and as a bonus it synchronizes with the trials of interacting with   or being   teenagers. fortunately akeem davis as  and victoria bonito as  imbue their characters with a surfeit of charm that more than justifies why their friends and family and the audience allow themselves to grow so invested in their futures. bonitos  is a young woman of action always pressing forward despite the many obstacles she faces. she openly displays her vulnerability even as she bravely charges into unknown emotional territory. davis meanwhile makes it clear why even  himself res verona brags of him to be a virtuous and well governd youth his  is truly gentle and while his own love is foremost in his mind he still cares deeply and unselfishly about everyone. he is appalled by the violence of the feud and honestly tries to reconcile with  for his own sake as well as s. when  too succumbs to violence in his fights with  and  he shows genuine remorse and disgust at killing other human beings. even in the depths of his suicidal despair he takes the time to express his concerns that the sickly drug dealing apothecary buy food and get thyself in flesh. davis and bonito play out the common teenage apprehension that no one truly understands how they feel while not completely accurate  and  are misjudged enough that their own best qualities lead them to their demise. if there is one problem with the direction it is that director david oconnor has made the characters too likable   to the extent that it is difficult to determine why the feud still continues. oconnor seems to foreground the idea that even ordinary people can commit extraordinary atrocities when pushed to the breaking point but the production lacks the simmering undercurrent of hatred and violence needed to justify those breaking points. s death scene highlights the problem with this approach using the productions own characterizations it simply makes no sense that the least threatening person in verona somehow manages to provoke  into stabbing him while he is unarmed. the escalation of conflict seems only dictated by the plays plot as opposed to emerging organically from the action. however oconnors direction is otherwise excellent. the production smoothly adapts to some rather significant editing of the text maintaining its major themes and relationships without sacrificing clarity. the dynamic blocking makes excellent use of the set perfectly demonstrated by the opening scene the amusing banter of  and  erupts into enthusiastic stage fighting which flows into the participants imprisoned behind the chain link fence as the prince passes sentence upon them. even the us choice of music   a mix of live accompaniment by the cast and a drum machine  synthesizer fuelled tribute to the 1980s   gels perfectly with the action. oconnor also features some interesting additions to the play sonnets written by locals for the show us your love competition in celebration of s 450th birthday which add a valuable dimension to the production. many of the sonnets touch on the alienation of falling in love echoing not just oconnors admissions of his own experiences but ultimately  and s emotional journey in the play. the title characters are namechecked specifically as the representatives of the ideal relationship for which the authors strive but the

poetry. my primary goal is to help audiences experience the play as if for the very first time he says in the release. he succeeds sort of for though ive now seen 21 stage productions of this play i did feel i was seeing it for the first time but not as if as posner contends. it was more like wtf? so much did he deviate from the text. for instance the opening brawl is presented as voice over during choruss prologue.  has a heated exchange with  while  is dying.  then seconds his nephew in s fight with . lady  poisons her wine as  in mantua learns of s supposed death. then there were all the ghosts appearing on the upper tier of meghan rahams spare metal set during the decimated final act. posner one of the most creative directors on the d.c. theater scene can be exasperating in the way he mingles scenes and interpolates his own visual imagery into s action. in this production his penchant for overlapping the dialogues of adjoining scenes is getting to be a more tiresome gimmick than brian de palmas split screen narratives. he also seems to get bored with his  productions by the time he gets to the final scenes which are generally rushed and overburdened with lazy stage business. nevertheless posner knows how to cast plays and he inspires great performances out of his actors. they in turn reveal new insights into their characters. in his program notes posner relates  and s timeless popularity to the ongoing endemic violence in our own society such as the newtown connecticut shootings and our unwillingness to end the violence. so which world we find ourselves wondering is actually a more difficult or more dangerous place to live? s verona or our america? he writes. he and costume designer laree lentz dress their fair verona as a blend of renaissance era italy and across 20th century rural cornish society.  wears an embroidered italian cloak and farmers boots lady  is in a sumptuous red gown and  in drab jacket and shin length loose fitting pants looks like he just finished his chores and is heading for the pub.  starts off wearing an oversized mans jacket perhaps her dads or s hand me down or baggy pajamas. for her marriage ceremony she wears a slim lace dress over black leotard and she is laid to rest in an almost regal riding coat. erin weaver brings a muscular quality to her . in her performance in tandem with michael goldsmiths  it is the girl who is the aggressor. she precipitates the first meeting with  and true to the text she initiates the path to marriage. she comes onto the balcony holding a plush toy as she meditates dreamily on s name but when she realizes  is there below she tosses the doll away and becomes all woman. in line count  dominates the balcony scene and in this production that apportionment represents their respective personalities she the reading romantic takes the lead he the notebook scribbling dreamer reacts. goldsmiths  finds himself in a series of similar acquiescing relationships with  with friar laurence with  and through  with . even his ending up in the  garden and his fight with  seem to evolve as happenstance. not until s supposed death does he turn determined and become the aggressor albeit against his own self.  like any teen age girl has a complicated relationship with her parents. she enjoys horsing around with her father but is also exasperated by the demands both parents place on her. when her mother broaches the topic of marriage weaver exhibits s rebellious spirit with the emphasis she lays on the last word of her response it is an honor that i dream not of. at one point she issues a middle finger salute to her mothers back. after being accosted by  in friar laurences cell weaver delivers the line o shut the door so peremptorily it draws a laugh from the audience. and weavers  is more than ready to stab herself in this scene with friar laurence but she hesitates doing so at the end when nobody is around to stop her. the s are a cornish veronese tony and carmella soprano. shannon koob plays lady  as a wealthy wife devoted to her family until it becomes too uncomfortable. brian dykstra plays lord  as gregarious and protective of his family but a thug nonetheless. when  waylays  an antsy rex daugherty aggressively loyal to his family name from attacking  at the masque dykstra uses a winking inflection as he says i would not for the wealth of all this town here in my house do him disparagement. wait until you are not in my house hes clearly saying and well rid ourselves of this little problem. sherri l. edelen uses inflection and nuance to give nurse an intriguing reading too. she is ever aware of her place as an employee in the great but dangerous  household but she also has a genuinely close relationship with  clearly nurse is s surrogate mother in this production. when lady  tells  of s interest in courting her nurse starts off exclaiming a man young lady lady such a man as all the world and with the dash here in the text edelen changes to a satirical tone as she continues why hes a man of wax. that tone continues when she picks up on lady s contention that veronas summer hath not such a flower. nay says nurse hes a flower in faith a very flower and her disparaging manner is obvious to us and to . such moments are vitally important in the character arc edelen pursues with nurse who is constantly looking out for s best interest. when she offers the advice that  should marry  joe mallon though shes already married to  edelens nurse homes in on s suddenly distancing tone so that when  then says she will go to friar laurence to make confession and to be absolved nurse seems to see right through her. this is wisely done nurse says reassuringly but her manner indicates to us if not to  that its not so much the absolution thats wisely done but consulting the friar nurse is confident hell work something out. the inimitable eric hissom plays friar laurence and as with any hissom performance this one is pure virtuosity. he slyly pulls out of s text a most appropriate condition for his friar hes a stoner partaking of baleful weeds and precious juiced flowers and the true qualities in plants herbs and stones. with this nurse especially but also with this lord and lady  and friar laurence too we are all set for a most interesting take on their discovery of the supposedly dead . but we dont get that. posner cuts out the scene altogether jumping from  drinking the potion to  describing his dream in mantua. the oh woe scene can come off as simply silly for a less than talented cast and a director who is too frightened to play it either for laughs or in all seriousness and cant find the tightrope path in between. this cast however has the talent but this director prefers to impose his own path. cutting that scene and the opening brawl the actors shout the lines of the brawl in the middle of choruss speech hissom also plays chorus the prince and the apothecary too can be excused on the grounds that they are difficult scenes to stage effectively. however adding a scene in which  reports to his uncle  his stabbing of  and  sends him back to face  is more than an unnecessary intrusion in s text because all of this miming action is happening on the upper stage even as  is suffering a heart wrenching death on the lower stage. brad koed is a bonhomie  brash but not too much so more carefree than delinquent and he gives a haunting performance when his  is peppered. the   activity above is felony larceny robbing koed of his moment as an actor and depriving us of our vested interest in this mans tragic demise. instead we are wondering what the heck is going on up there a confusion topped when  then follows  back to the main stage and stands knife drawn hiding behind a pillar. is he planning to kill ? this attention dividing device becomes a mainstay for the plays last act. as s final scenes play out on the stage below first  then  come out on the upper level and watch the action. soon lady  michele osherow joins them after weve seen her drink the poisoned wine. so when  kills  offstage we can hear the fight we spend the entirety of s last scene watching for  to appear above. he finally does when  dies. the point? i have no idea. i just know it diminishes what posner himself calls the richness in the story and so much poetry in the language. the final scene the lovers lying dead on the stage no they dont depart and enter above with the rest of the ghosts skips over the conciliation of  and  and everybody living and dead turns and stares accusingly at the audience. the message is that we are responsible for newtown for navy yard for sparks nevada and for  and  too. not so fast. on this very stage in 2005 pj paparelli staged a post columbine  and  in which the sins of the fathers pass to the sons and on down to their young teen protégés a generational spiral of socially condoned violence. with posners  and  the violence seems to be a matter of individual personalities and choice. his own production seems to have missed the point he was wanting to make. but then its hard to make any point stick in the heart when the mind is too puzzled. the review also appears on ances.com.,2,Tragedy,Negative
Romeo & Juliet,"Much To Do with Hate, But More with Love",Jennifer Kramer,for their ninth season the  theatre companys goal is a focus on women and the exploration of gender roles. when their  and  went into production shortly after the repeal of the defense of marriage act director krista apple hodge made the decision to cast the eponymous lovers as two young women an attempt to prove the universality of s tragic love story for people of all romantic and sexual orientations. the production has a modern setting a choice that wisely highlights its current relevance. apple hodge and set designer paul kuhn were inspired by the contrast between the ancient architecture and the trappings of modern life in present day verona. the result is a fantastic set where marble esque columns support matte black metal balconies that lead to the loft of a pipe organ church doors are set into scaffolding and graceful archways allow entry through crumbling brick and plaster walls   all beneath the soaring vault of calvary church beautiful despite its disrepair where racks of stage lights hang down above the small section of the sanctuary cordoned off into a theater. though visually arresting this is not perhaps the most efficient design when it comes to lighting friar laurences cell in particular suffered from obscurity by both darkness and inconveniently placed support pillars. despite its inconveniences the set seamlessly melds the productions inspirations with its performance space. the modern dress costume design by aetna gallagher is more subdued. the differences between the two houses both alike in dignity exemplified by lady  and lord  largely seem to stem from the age old rivalry of businesswear vs. business casual with the prince and his men always appearing in uniform. the younger generation is not strictly bound to this dress code however  wears her white button down and usly biker esque blazer with skinny jeans and doc martins  pairs his waistcoat with skater sneakers  sports black nail polish and apparently cannot remember how to operate the buttons on his shirt  tops off her girly dresses and preppy casuals with an overlarge hoodie whenever alone. only  as the sole character who remembered to dress for a gang fight fully flouts the sartorial trends of her family opening wearing a dagger with her punk rock finery. the color palette is very somber perhaps an allusion to the unrest simmering just under the surface of fair verona most of the cast wear black or neutrals with a smattering of muted colors and s faded pastels. the only spot of brightness is the blood red trim on the uniforms of the prince. as  rachel gluck must not only take on the mantle of one of literatures most infamous lovers but given the productions re conception of the play as a lesbian love story must do so in a way still seen by some as controversial. gluck rises to the occasion but her greatest accomplishment is the way she imbues all of s relationships with the same warmth and love. her affectionate banter with  and  her enthusiastic friendship with friar laurence and of course her passionate love for  all demonstrate the same easy physicality and charisma that clearly explain why  is such an attractive figure around whom the plot revolves. isa st. clairs  is a close match for her both in the strength of her other relationships with her nurse her mother and her implied closeness to  and interestingly in her own self confidence. aged up to eighteen in this production st. clair plays a  who is inexperienced but not naive though she expresses her doubts they seem more like temporary hiccups in her process of reaching decisions she has already resolved upon. unlike the americans affected by doma and more generalized homophobia  and s path to marriage is rather surprisingly smooth though hidden from their families their romance has the full support of their closest friends and both glucks  and st. clairs  appear quite secure in their sexuality. their confidence is echoed by the majority of the cast who all possess an impressive facility with the language and handle interesting adjustments to the plays characters completely separate from the productions central conceit with relative ease. josh hitchens is a very youthful friar laurence replacing the standard wise mentor archetype with a charming dynamic where  and s confidante is one of their contemporaries who acts like an   often exasperated   older brother and who also succombs to the impulsiveness of youth when making life altering decisions. aetna gallagher as lady  meanwhile plays a chilling composite of both of s parents. she highlights the toxicity of a character who sports a pleasant façade but instantly turns on her daughter when  refuses to marry a stranger that following thursday. gallagher also augments s in text brutal rejection of  with physical and emotional abuse of  played by colleen hughes. hughes  is visibly damaged her openly carried weaponry unable to protect her from her aunts ire and her irrational hatred of s a stark contrast to her almost desperate devotion and easily shattered bravado. director apple hodge strikes a deft balance with these disparate relationships refusing to let the central romance overwhelm the production. this actually serves to enrich that romance  and  appear as fully rounded characters with lives beyond their romantic relationship giving weight to the sacrifices they make for their love and deepening the tragedy when their efforts fail. apple hodges mastery elevates the occasionally clunky dialogue changes and even attempts to overshadow the awkward stage fighting and lamentable habit of slain characters to twitch uncontrollably in death. however in one respect the focus on the the plays interpersonal relationships actually works to the detriment of the production. by eliminating the thumb biting scene and replacing it with a brawl of as yet indistinguishable combatants the bulk of the feuds portrayal falls on hughes  whose personal reasons for lashing out seem more urgent than simply continuing an ancient grudge. once  is dead the feud essentially becomes a non issue additional complications like s death have been cut. the ominous undercurrent of the two families mutual hatred and near civil war is almost lost among individual conflicts   which sadly undercuts the impact of  and s death when the strength of their forbidden love is supposed to bring peace to even the most bitterly divided rivals. however those individual conflicts are quite compelling in their own right. as a production of  and  the  theatre companys rendition is slightly flawed but highly enjoyable as a love story between two women between family and between friends it is wholly reable.,4,Tragedy,Positive
Romeo & Juliet,So a Cat and a Dog Fall in Love...,J. A. Macfarlane,its well known that the s and the s go at it like cats and dogs. one rarely gets to see this literalised however. but what better way to get across the extent of their feud to a group of children than to have them literally be cats and dogs? the manipulators excellent puppeteers trish leeper and allan martin seize on this idea with gusto and play it to the hilt. it is perhaps too obvious that the names will be somewhat altered but if the catulets were easy to predict i have to admit i didnt see the muttagaues coming. the names are scarcely the only things to change in fact this is not exactly a performance of  and     hence why its actually called rovero and . it does however contain the bare bones of the story and is an excellent way to introduce children to . much as i may rebel at the sight of an actor with a questionably rural english accent announce himself to be 9 year old billy  the explanation for the changed story   that this is the original as written by  at the age of nine with a happy ending and later revised as a tragedy for london audiences   sets up whats coming well. besides this pre prologue coming as it does before the official prologue introduces us to billys mother who is a wonderful piece of work. the plot we get is as follows rovero is endlessly pursuing  who dumps him.  to console him his mother gives him his fathers sword.  roveros nerdish friend  convinces him to go to the catulets party but rovero ends up in a fight with the jock  a lion in a sports tank top.  a lovely grey cat with blue eyes and a crush on justin beaver how could they resist is told by her nurse a cow that her father is planning to marry her off. she and rovero meet and the balcony scene ensues. rovero suddenly finds himself engaged to be married a bit uncertain as to how that happened. however he has to leave town because hes wanted by the police for that fight with . married by friar  a dromedary he leaves town. the nurse comes up with the sleeping potion idea. heres where things get a little nuts and the stage starts to fill up like the end of  rovero returns sees the catatonic   and despairingly drinks the potion too. then lady muttague and lord catulet arrive and in despair drink the potion as well.  and  come in  at first grieves but quickly starts flirting with  and they down some of the potion too. the friar and the nurse enter recognise each other as their long lost love realise theyre likely to be blamed for everything and elope then everyone wakes up and are reconciled it being revealed that the parents had a bit of a fling back in the day which was at the root of their feud.  and  are carted off still asleep  is seduced by the police officer and the stone dog and cat heads decorating the towers of the set give us an epilogue. put more briefly it hasnt got much to do with s play but the kids will love it as well they might. and its exceptionally well done. its a classic puppet show with the puppets acting over a curtain and it is at times hard to believe that there are only two puppeteers manipulating and voicing all the characters. the script is hilarious full of lovely details   the fact that roveros dad was run over by an spca van for instance   and well thought out jokes on animal nature. rovero in particular is both convincingly dog like and at times hangdog and convincingly young. repeating for  the charmers lines he unsuccessfully tried on  he is clearly out of his depth never quite sure how he got himself engaged to . meanwhile ultra romantic  swoons and plots as well as going on an all too convincing catnip bender when rovero brings her a chewtoy stuffed with it. what sort of example is that for the children? along with their superlative puppeteering skills the sheer dogginess of allan martins rovero has to be seen to be believed the two performers put on a marvelous range of voices that match their characters perfectly from the high strung pekingese  to the lecherous cocker spaniel officer  the smarmy upper class twit  and the deeply nerdy  whose excuse for neither getting into fights nor talking to girls is that hes lost his contact lens despite wearing glasses. also of note is the inventive set with two towers on either side of the curtain bearing a dogs head and a cats head respectively which speak the prologue and epilogue behind which are revolving walls allowing for rapid scene changes though on occasion they turned in the wrong direction before being corrected much to the audiences delight.  i doubt many people in the audience didnt want to bring the majestic portrait of lord catulet home with them and the muttagues larder   containing nothing but row upon row of tins ed dog food is delightful   as is the sight of rovero being fed a bowl of said dog food at the table. the production cant help but bring to mind susan herberts  cats another of the great ways to introduce children to . the writing as mentioned is both inventive perfect for the age level and hilarious. im not sure why discovering that lady muttague and lord catulets names are veronica and hamish is so hilarious but it is. the nurse giving  a tongue bath do you think i like it any more than you? the swords with bananas impaled on the end everybodys inability to think that  is anything but a girls name the friar pointedly asking how old the young uns are  one could list much of the script.  its much simpler to just encourage you to grab a ticket. particularly as its educational as well i cannot applaud the manipulators enough for having  forcefully explain to rovero that wherefore means why not where.,5,Tragedy,Positive
Romeo & Juliet,ASC Proves This Tale's Timeless Place,Eric Minton,the avengers masks are apt allegories. the modern costumes brilliant in design and execution erin m. west are contextual references for the characters. strip away the clothing and the blackfriars playhouse being a replica of s indoor theater the stage is already bare and you get a  and  that is as pure as the one  gave birth to. which takes some getting used to in fact. this is the 20th stage production of this play ive seen and the seventh in the past year including the four schoolboy adaptation s rj and ive grown accustomed to thematic concepts among them homosexuality hyperactive teens mafia families the ironic generation columbine inspired violence tech savviness and 1847 california. how strange to see this play as simply about two households both alike in dignity in fair verona and the pair of star cd lovers they breed. but wow what a good timeless play  wrote. one of the few times i saw such a textcentric  and  was on this very stage in 2010 and from this very director american  center artistic director jim warren helming a production by the ascs touring troupe. that production even with some good performances lacked passion and played with shackled energy. this time out though warren unleashes the verse through impassioned playing and perfect utilization of the blackfriars space.  dylan paul tightropes his way along the wall separating the lords chairs from the stage he even leaps over the audience sitting on the gallant stools. he climbs down from s balcony after their wedding night on the cords  specifically shows us in the play itself. the monument scene combines action in the playhouses upper gallery on the center of the stage and in the backstage space giving spatial sense to s and s encounter. for passion you get s and s who really really i mean really hate each other but clearly with no cause. theres no reason for this feud theres no right side in the feud warren writes in his program notes. neither family is better than the other. theres no reason why  should not be able to be matched with . but theres plenty of reason why they should be matched. look at him look at her tracie thomason listen to her the wit with which  traipses gently toward womanhood. listen to him an intelligent romantic who recognizes that about him is much to do with hate while he wants only more with love. paul embodies the descriptive phrase applied to his character gentle . paul is a reable talent shining bright in the chandelier of talent that illuminates every asc production. his  is never mushy or trite but merely youthful and yet mature. pauls physical agility is matched by his agility with the verse ever engaging from his opening scenes with  chris ston to his poison swallowing death. for all the famous passages this play has s banishment speech to friar laurence is this productions verbal highlight as paul truly bereaved steers his indubitably logical train of thought through raw emotion at its destination he is physically spent curled on the floor. every member of the cast makes the most of their moments on stage combining their an skills with deep understanding of their characters and their contexts. i want a world in which everyone is making the best possible choices for the people they love and it still goes tragically wrong warren writes in his program notes. this context is most manid in rené thornton jr.s portrayal of . he shows his common sense side when he forbids   harrell from attacking  at the party. upon discovering that  has been murdered at the hands of that same  thornton uses the fact that  has no lines in that scene as direction for overwhelming speechlessness. were not sure he really liked  thorntons  watches with some apprehension his wife played with particular sharpness by lee fitzpatrick shrilly mourn over their kinsmans body but were sure hes not in a place physically or emotionally he can handle at that moment. afterward we see him pondering and then deciding to marry  to  as a means to lift not just his daughter but his whole household out of grief. when this blows up in his face upon s refusal thornton shows genuine pain in the disappointment hurt in the anger. his behavior is nothing about domination and status but all about confusion and care turned heartbreak. warren engages in what might seem counterintuitive casting in having allison glenzer play friar laurence and benjamin curns play nurse. were used to seeing glenzer doing nurse type roles and curns doing friar type roles but the casting here is inspired. curns skirts the pantomime style of men playing women in giving a genuinely comic portrayal of the mumbling fool in the comic first half. curnss nurse then becomes a tragic figure in the plays second half bringing  the news of the   catastrophe being the messenger between  and  and advising  to marry  as a matter of practicality. shes riding a runaway train she thinks has brakes and her discovering  supposedly dead is the moment the train plunges into the ravine of deepest despair and curns plunges in after in portraying nurses anguish. by keeping intact the wedding preparation scenes warren through  shows the nurse to be very much a member of the family devoted to all the s and fondly regarded by them and we see this in the family unit portrayed by curns thornton thomason and fitzpatrick. warren also keeps in the scene of  scamming the musicians after s initial death scene.  would with  perfect the device of inserting comic relief at the height of suspense but he doesnt manage it skillfully here unless he meant s supposed death to be played as comedy as ive seen it done. admirable though it may be that warren keeps the scene out of devotion to a textcentric production sometimes  like all writers great and less so deserves editing. glenzer skillfully navigates her friar laurence through his meditations his comic reactions to s behavior his earnest counsel to both  and  his urgent anger over the waylaid letter to  and his panic in the tomb. it all leads to glenzers heart shattering delivery of laurences explanation to the prince of everything thats transpired. this is a priest in trouble yes its also a caretaker whose attempts to help two youngsters have backfired. what really sinks this friar at this moment is revealed in the way glenzer speaks the line that  too desperate would not go with me but as it seems did violence on herself. the actresss voice cracks and her posture shrivels as the priest tries to come to terms with the fact that by saving his reputation he allowed the girl to kill herself. this is glenzers second revealing moment in her portrayal of the friar. i do spy a kind of hope laurence says in staying  from killing herself in his monastic cell and glenzer makes this an ah ha moment for the friar remembering the sleeping dram. its an ah ha moment for me too. ive written in many of my reviews of  and  that the measure of a successful production is whether the audience accepts the inevitability of the outcome or sees s plot as one full of holes. by so concentrating on s text instead of an overlaid conceptual context and by following warrens decree that the characters choices all emanate from desire to do good glenzers friar laurence here is crystalizing a complex assessment. in the immediate instant he must keep  from harming herself in the surrounding circumstances he must buy time to get beyond the murder of  which is obviously too fresh in the minds of the s their rash speed to get  married indicates their current dysfunction in the long term he must reveal the marriage of  and . perhaps s supposed death not only would buy time but temper the s ultimate reaction by turning her resurrection even as a  bride into a joyful reunion. all of this glenzer conveys in this moment making perfect sense of friar laurences motives.  jon phelps plays  as an intelligent manchild powering through life on the fuel of self centered arrogance kind of like robert downey jr. as tony stark aka iron man. countering s belief in dreams phelps delivers s queen mab speech as theater physically and expressively animated without becoming manically so. when  stops him saying he talks of nothing phelps replies almost sheepishly true a delivery that earns a laugh. but after the laughter drifts away phelpss  looks to  in sly know it all triumph i talk of dreams. the tony stark reference is not one i conjured myself it is there in the production. for the s masque   and  wear avengers masks.  not only dons the iron man mask but mimics that characters movements and poses when doing so.  wears captain america choosing to be the heroic innocent is an apt reflection of the  in this play.  meanwhile chooses the hulk a bit of inside  humor despite s name meaning peacemaker a role he tries to play twice in the play  accuses him of being quick to brawl on the slightest provocation. perhaps  is a bit of bruce banner the mild manner scientist who is ever aware that the slightest flick of temper will transform him into the hulk and ston plays the part with a nervous finger on the trigger edge underneath his fun seeking veneer. while the masks are obvious character allegories and perhaps a subtle tribute to writer and director of the avengers movie joss whedon whose film version of much ado about nothing hit theaters the same time this  and  hit the blackfriars the overall costuming also carries thematic links to the characters. except for  in a red plaid shirt black vest and jeans and  in blue print dress and tennis shoes west dresses the characters with ultra mod fashion in mind.  a status aware simpleton in the performance of tim sailer wears the suit and fedora stylings of frank sinatra with the sleekness and shine of vintage trouble. lord  curns wears a long white coat with fire red trim while emily brown as lady  is in a red blouse and gold embroidered knee length red skirt. lord  is all shiny blue vest pants tie jacket while lady  is in a tight blue dress with a short train showing snow leopard facing. the facing also appears in slashings across one side of the dress which is a motif made more interesting by the fact that  in addition to his sword wears an archers glove with talon claws on the knuckles with which he scratches .  in coat with tails striped trousers and cravat resembles a deadwood gunslinger in appearance and  harrell plays him with a cocky composure borne of his sense of honor. he doesnt take his bout with  as a joke though  is having a high time. however when he returns to the stage after s death harrells  sees full well that something significant has changed . instead of going wild with anguish pauls  grows calm with self realization and resolve a moment when he clearly steps from youthful innocence onto his familys track of violence. both s and s swords are still on the ground and upon s return  with determined control kicks his sword to him. its a  that harrells  has never seen before and it makes him rightly nervous. thomasons  also has a clarified moment when she consciously slips through the safety net of childhood as she prepares to take the friars sleep like death dram. after her mother and nurse have left her bedchamber  hits a wall of fear and calls for the nurse but  then says what should she do here? thomasons  decides in that moment that as  had said at his moment this days black fate on more days doth depend thus but begins the woe others must end. theres no going back her course will lead where it will. both  and  would later rue their shedding the shackles of innocence dont we all. but instead of turning back to their safety nets for at the least temporary respite and repair they choose to take another step on their course to self destruction the final step in fact. never was a story of more woe for so we truly feel at the end of this presentation of  and her

Romeo & Juliet,"Thugs, Hookers, and Hip-hop in Toronto's Romeo and Juliet",J. A. Macfarlane, and  is very likely the most difficult of s plays to stage not inherently but because it is both so well  and so poorly known by the general public.  everyones read it or thinks they have everyone knows the ending and it can seem that everythings been done.  the full range has been explored on film between the polar opposites of zeffirelli and luhrmann and west side story lurks in the background of any attempt to adapt. nobody is immune from these difficulties a fact that director jeremy hutton acknowledges in his program note for his production at the hart house theatre and for that reason he has chosen not to attempt to be original for the sake of being original. instead he blares italian hip hop at us all night long. also  arrives to the opening battle as a retired gentleman bearing a bayonet tipped ak 47. yes well why not? as this may suggest this is a modernised production a choice bringing with it a series of pitfalls that hutton does not entirely avoid and some into which he gleefully plunges headfirst. the most obvious of these is the negotiation between  and  for s hand.  in a period production this scene is not particularly difficult and helps establish that  is a rather inoffensive young man just what a father would want in a son in law.  in modern dress however all one sees is this nice young man negotiating to marry a fourteen year old.  this is always problematic in this case it is not helped by the discovery that  apparently makes his money from strip clubs and having the negotiations take place while  and  perch on leopard skin armchairs with a number of pole dancers in the background. just in case  wasnt sleazy enough. the saving grace of this scene is alexis budd who absconds with the scene as the only male among the dancers to s great discomfort as the four half naked dancers surround him. from the very beginning hutton and his crew put a great deal of effort into creating this thugs and hookers world where the men carry machetes and every woman in the street seems likely to be on the game. the volatility of this world catches us from the first though one wonders how its tawdriness will affect the main story.  the answer is quite simple the gangster world will simply vanish in the second half.  which is rather a problem because one wonders where it has gone where the army jacketed machete wielding hoodlums fit into this tragedy of upper middle class families.  this shift in tonality does highlight how  and  moves from the public sphere to the private and just how intimate a play it is after the death of  and .  but it is jarring and partly because the crowd scenes are so well handled. the fight scenes have genuine energy and more importantly chaos it is believable that the prince would need his guards to fire bursts of gunfire to bring the opening brawl to an end. in his role as fight director hutton can be proud as can his assistant budd. the fight between  and    a battle rather than a duel   is the most gripping i have seen. choreographer melanie mastronardi can also be proud of her work. the party scene is always a challenge particularly in finding a way for the lovers to converse intimately in public and this production rises to the task magnificently. the rave like atmosphere with mist and lasers creating a gaudy nightclub effect as  welcomes his guests makes for a believably wild night and for once the music does not distract from the plot. more to the point the setting allows hutton to naturalistically create a magical backdrop for  and s first meeting as a thousand spots of green light make a star filled night out of the party and the full company becomes an abstract balletic accompaniment to that momentous event. it is a truly entrancing moment. other moments are less so and this is where one simply has to talk about the music. i freely admit from the start that i have no taste for hip hop and therefore cannot judge whether the italian variety we were subjected to is good or bad i am willing to admit its effectiveness in terms of the party as well as in the fight scenes.  but the decision to use it as a soundtrack to every scene change in the first half of the evening is simply a mistake. unlike the einaudi piano music used for the quiet moments and in the second half the hip hop is simply loud and ruins every quiet scene it follows by jerking the audience away from the atmosphere that has just been created to this new one. this is particularly egregious at the end of the balcony scene. it might be argued for were that scene followed by one of high energy but rather the transition merely leads to a scene of passed out hoodlums and hookers into which friar  bicycles. scott moore as  and also speaking the prologue is quite good his innate cowardice being nicely revealed at the end. however though it is fair enough to see him involved with drugs given his opening monologue i have to question his purchasing them from a stoned thug lying on the ground. the moment could have been used to indicate a moral flaw in  his willingness to break rules but not enough is made of it for this to seem anything more than gratuitous.  meanwhile is played by a hairdo a reable coiffe that holds the eyes astonished gaze as it moves about the stage while paolo santalucia on top of whom it perches speaks s lines. perhaps i jest unfairly it is a pleasure to see an understated  though it does lead him to occasionally appear more luckless than a mover of his own tragedy.  perhaps the prologues star cd was taken literally as not only does  kill  under s arm with a bullet from across the stage   surely reducing s guilt in the matter   but even s death seems the accidental result of a struggle rather than an intended act. fate works against this  more than he does himself. beginning quite rightly as a word happy emo kid he quickly outgrows that to become a quiet and sensitive fellow. it is noticeable that he does not attempt to fight  on his own terms but shoots him. all in all he is convincing though he suffers from some of the directors choices. in particular there is no excuse for his addressing but soft what light from yonder window breaks? simply to the window without  there to be the sun of which he speaks. darwin lyons as  manages some effective moments in the quieter parts of the play and her giddiness at the end of the balcony scene is convincingly charming. as  jesse phillips gives a fine performance. he is especially good when  defies him. though he is made to batter his daughter   something directors never seem to be able to resist doing just in case the words didnt make it clear enough that  is acting the tyrant   he also gets across s genuine disappointment in his daughter the fact that he truly has been doing everything in his power to assure her of a happy life. it is worth noting that until the previous evenings party by all accounts  agreed with him. one feels that  lashes out quite so harshly not merely because it is his nature his thrashing of  mirrors exactly that he gives  at the party but also that with s death he feels events pressing in on him and his daughters intransigence leads him to snap. particularly fine are  and the nurse.  is a role that steals the show whether or not the actor tries to and joshua browne both tries and succeeds.  switching between bouts of hyperactive physical activity and utter repose his rapid fire delivery of his lines keeps up a high level of energy and his charismatic ascendancy over his friends is entirely believable. but there is an edge of instability to him too by the end of the queen mab speech it is clear that  has to stop him because not only will he otherwise go on forever one feels him coming close to losing his grip on reality. that edge returns in time for s duel with  where his disgust with s pusillanimity turns to genuine violence against  leading to as i said the most memorable  fight i have witnessed. meanwhile lesley robertson whom i last saw as julia in two gentlemen of verona gives a brilliant performance as the nurse possibly the best acting of the evening.  much younger than usual and therefore closer to a friend of s than a mother or grandmother figure she offers a richly nuanced characterisation that leads one to feel depths to the nurse one simply does not expect to find there. on the page the nurse is a rather one note character and a silly note it is too. robertson finds a full three dimensionality for her. one feels that the nurse has a past beyond a dead daughter and a dead husband and though what that past might be can always be unknown its presence makes itself felt. the nurse seems to be caught up in the excitement of s first love and not necessarily thinking it through until it grows too late.  torn between her love for her charge and her realisation that things are spinning out of control her final betrayal   advising  to marry    seems not a sudden break but a logical outcome particularly as the advice is obviously difficult for her to give.  one tiny moment sums it up finding  apparently dead on her wedding morning the nurse sees a bottle in her hand the vial that held the sleeping draught. clearly thinking that  has committed suicide she takes it and hides it to cover up that fact before she calls for help. it is in such tiny subtle details that this production truly shines. another example that comes to mind is the aforementioned parallel between the violence  dishes out to  and to . what may go unnoticed is that in the wake of s public humiliation  goes to comfort him. it is rare to see a production suggesting that  might actually care for her cousin and it strengthens the sense of s isolation when having been on the receiving end of much the same beating she finds no comforter herself. against such subtleties we must balance the idea that a pair of sunglasses is enough to disguise s identity at the  party and the major question of the first half whats with all the hookers? and why must every effective quiet moment be followed by blaring hip hop? despite its tonal unevenness however on average this is a fine production with a good crop of supporting actors. premier dalton mcguinty lookalike  paci is a very good prince both commanding in tone and ineffectual in action. jeremy lapalmes  is darker than he is usually shown to be a frequenter of prostitutes in whom he tries to interest  and for once s attacks on him as a quarrelsome man seem believable. as  athan sousa is less in evidence than in many productions pointing out that it is in fact quite a small role he makes the most of it however adding the extra dimension of s utter humiliation at being publicly thrown to the ground by his uncle.  the lighting is excellent and the sets above par for what one expects from a university production.,4,Tragedy,Positive
Romeo & Juliet,Romeo at the Rosemary ,Craig Melson,the great thing about theatre pubs is the sheer imagination that goes into every production. they arent very big or have a lot of money to put on major productions so each one has to step up the creativity to engage the audience and this particular production of  and  at the rosemary branch theatre in londons islington does a good job. with limited resources director bryony thompson does a commendable job in a stripped down sub two hour version of  and . apart from the two leads each actor plays several parts and the entire ensemble only numbers seven. in cutting the play many lines get shoehorned onto other characters. for example both  and  lose a parent and minor family members on both sides are cut.  is played excellently by carla kingham who seems a lot younger than other productions much nearer the text as it was written. kingham clearly understands how sheltered and protected  is and she subtly demonstrates that her yearning for freedom is more about rebellion than a real desire to escape. in essence she gets the line between feisty and vulnerable just right. ben irelands  at first feels too intense and romantic to be taken seriously but improves in the second half as the plot heats up. he falls for  easily even after killing  and being exiled he still swoons around like bryon contemplating his love for  above all else ignoring the fact he has lost his friend and murdered a man in one night. apart from the acting the production is sensual and atmospheric. the music is essential to this production with a loud score accompanying all the major scenes. one technical issue is that at points the music is perhaps too domineering and too loud. jason eddy who acts as chorus and as the friar is frequently found in the middle of the performance space acting as a dj and as musician with actors performing around him. this embrace of modernity is very welcomed seemingly influenced by the 1996 baz luhrmann film however it contrasts with the costumes and scenery which are very traditional. the men have flowing open shirts and the women appear in old looking knitwear. this juxtaposiiton works well with elements of the old and new contrasting. thompson also acts as producer and costume designer. thompsons lighting is too dim at points which adds to the intensity as all attention is focused on the actors yet some of the cast seem put off by this. a well staged production this take shows that  and  can be done with imagination and a new perspective even if resources are scarce. ,3,Tragedy,Negative
Romeo & Juliet,Alike in Dignity: The Lantern Theater’s Romeo and Juliet,Jennifer Kramer,as one of s most well known tragedies any rendition of  and  must contend not only with the usual challenges in staging a production but also with the weight of the plays enormous legacy   particularly that of the star crossd love of the titular couple. however the lantern theater company with director  mcmahon ground their production in the social turmoil that generates the tragedy and offer a production whose whole is comprised of the strength of all its parts. the casts most impressive attribute is their cohesiveness as an ensemble. in conversation as well as in more extended discourse they have an excellent grasp of s language and a particular talent for making it sound colloquial. equally excellent is their non verbal communication sean lally as  and nicole erb as  anchor the complex set of relationships and loyalties in play among the characters. their relative naivete and innocence is signaled by an easy affection   particularly  with her nurse ceal phelan and  with  kevin meehan  charlie delmarcelle and friar laurence frank x   that the rest of the older jaded characters always respond to but seldom imitate. this is taken to its extremity in the aloofness of the s whose impending fracturing is presaged by lord leonard c. haas and lady k.o. delmarcelle s inability to express genuine physical affection unless one of their number is dead or seemingly so. this strong group dynamic is augmented by the tightness of the casting with seventeen roles divided among a cast of nine   though several actors shine the brightest in certain roles. frank x also appearing as the chorus gives friar laurence an air of frustrated gravitas his kindness and dignity desperately trying to keep up with his impetuous flock. likewise charlie delmarcelle also playing the prince delivers an atypical  whose apparent flashbacks during his queen mab speech suggest a character uncomfortably well versed in bloodshed eagerly trying to escape it in revelry   but just as easily returning to it to challenge the upstart . however the most affecting performance belongs to nicole erb as  sweetly neurotic in her first romance   then tragically so after the death of  an event that clearly breaks her even as she struggles to stay alive and in love. erb plays s situation as a genuine dilemma hesitating to choose a feigned or real death while still desperate to make such a choice and receive its bitter but guaranteed freedom. mary folinos costuming strikes an excellent balance between authenticity and accessibility consistently reminiscent of the renaissance while avoiding the inevitable distraction of period hose. the costumes are beautifully made divided on a spectrum of class rich brocades for the nobles less ornate but still strikingly textured cloths for the lower classes and allegiance tending to burgundy for the s and navy for the s but with a realistic array of variation for individual temperament. they perfectly complement meghan joness set design which follows a similar aesthetic warmly lit mediterranean buildings form the backdrop plaster painted in parma yellow with burnt sienna curtains and realistic marble looking capstones and stairways. the unique diamond shaped layout of the theater allows for a satisfyingly complicated escher like design for the architecture a gallery lining one wall and a portico leading up to the obligatory balcony on the other with a plenitude of entryways either visible or tucked away in the nooks and crannies of the architecture. the only misstep seems to be the one permanent piece of furniture a bench planted in the corner downstage right that has the dubious honor of allowing the actors to face away from both halves of the audience at once. overall though both set and costuming serve to enhance the production with traditional   but never boring   designs adding welcome detail without overwhelming the actors or the action. director  mcmahons intention to highlight the severity of veronas internal strife becomes immediately apparent as the play opens not with the comic duo of  supporters samson and  of thumb biting fame but by a somewhat clunky montage of citizens attempting to go about their business without being waylaid by their enemies. fortunately this is expanded upon more organically by the casts performances which make it clear how damaged the characters have become by their feud. enhancing both the actors portrayals and the overall theme of the play are the fairly realistic fight scenes choreographed by fight director j. alex cordaro.  jake blouch displays all the pompous showmanship assigned to him by  who follows through on the subtext of his queen mab speech with an effective and dirty style worthy of a soldier.  meanwhile rarely goes armed and his slaying of  clearly owes more to his immediate rage than habitual violence. however mcmahon cuts s encounter with  at the s tomb and deprived of the most senseless victim of the feud   a man neither a  nor a  killed in self defense during a misunderstanding by a suicidal  who bears him no animosity whatsoever   the plays focus abruptly switches wholly over to the lovers personal story rather than sharing time with the public ramifications of the social turmoil. given mcmahons successful emphasis of the feuds effects throughout the production it is a distinctly unsatisfactory ending to have this theme abruptly dropped. however for the most part mcmahon delivers a well crafted and consistent imagining of his vision supported by the production design and enhanced by the casts energetic and nuanced performances. the lantern theaters  and  successfully counterpoises the classic love story with the civil unrest promised by the very first mention of two households both alike in dignity and in doing so offers a refreshingly engaging interpretation.,5,Tragedy,Positive
Romeo & Juliet,Down and Dirty Romeo and Juliet Could be Dirtier,Barry Eitel,a few years ago a couple mates in london deeming themselves the factory theatre company cobbled together a loose production of  and toured it around town in bars on street corners and on the sets of shows having an off night. the cast would be changed up every night and the actors would use whatever props were available whether provided by the space or the audience including a live infant one night. they preferred an underground aura inspired by flash mobs and banksy. they didnt send out press passes but rather a mass email every week detailing where the next show was going to be. the press did come and loved it. so did movie stars including ewen mcgregor. this factory  was raw hip yet still very . one viewer among the hundreds who saw the factorys production was roger smart the artistic director for chicagos shattered globe theatre. he imports the factorys ethos over the atlantic but uses  and  as his platform. the plan is to sweep this production to whomever will take it whether a bar park or stage. all the actors can perform several roles and the audience votes via an official applause o meter aka smarts ears for who plays what. like in london the story gobbles up the space and audience exploiting everything to serve the story. this model should work very well in chicago. we love underground stuff. however the production explosive as it is doesnt go as extreme as it could. it needs some refining the show teeters dangerously between production and acting class final. the performance i saw was upstairs at the spot a cozy little bar that provides an ideal space for the show. upon entering we receive a little nametag that identifies us as a  or a . then we vote on who plays whom. theres like five million actors involved in this production. only a fraction comes to each show but there are several options for almost every role. on the night i went steve peebles played  and dion rice played  two men in this inadvertent gender bent production. rebecca cox was voted nurse christina goman nabbed  and angie shriner one of the picks for  got . we also elected a mama and papa  a friar a  really far too many characters. id say the audience should vote for the star cd lovers and let the supporting cast sort themselves out. it would make character actor identification much easier. s  and  is great fodder for this style of in your face poetry. theres humor including quite a few not safe for junior high english class references to genitalia. and i always love a good bar fight especially when it involves daggers and swords. greg poljaciks violent design doesnt shy away from close shaves to the audience although it is a bit draggy for my taste probably a necessity due to the tight proximity to non actors. the tragedy of the piece punches through stunningly which isnt an easy feat considering the story is known to anybody with a high school diploma. the extent of the audience involvement is ill formed. we all take different sides i was a  in case you were wondering. we hurl some an barbs at the opposing crowd creating the cacophony that starts the show. other than that the family division isnt used much. we sit together. we all receive invitations to the  ball a detail that seemed overlooked. some s are asked to dance. the dancing however provides a nicely chaotic backdrop to s love at first sight especially since someone knocked a drink to the floor the night i went. obviously with a show like this the mostly young actors carry the day. each does a worthy job. the language is well handled and respected. the cast occasionally falls into the habit over contemporizing s verse but thats a minor irritation. the performances are highly physical and use whatever levels they can find. sometimes though i wondered if were just shelling out the money to watch actors have fun with an old text. more weight could be placed on the story the plot could be better crafted. smarts hand is largely absent from the piece besides an especially tragic turn at the end. the interesting consequence of american idol style casting is that different themes are highlighted. the show begs for repeat viewings. on my night for example the show involuntarily brought up gay marriage racial divides and feminist theory with gomans highly sexualized portrayal of . thats the shows real strength. its also definitely worth a taste for  haters the energys intense the iambic pentameters well articulated and the story never bores. this is a  and  for the 21st century great recession and all.,4,Tragedy,Positive
Romeo & Juliet,Swashbuckling with the Bard,Barry Eitel, with a script like  and  which every middle school student has read the problem with any production is that the play is overdone. the young lovers story is familiar the monologues are collectively memorized there can be no shocking twists. a theatre company has to make a truly compelling argument as to why they slipped it into their season. babes with blades who built a following with their focus on female empowerment through fight choreography claim their treatment opens the play up in new ways. they may pull at the seams thematically but director brian laduca and his all female cast fail to make this piece truly their own. in line with their name this production promises babes and blades. the re envisioning of  and  stands on three conceptual legs only ladies in the cast loads of slicing and dicing and transferring the elizabethan era text to late 19th century italy just before the antics of mussolini. the two first ideas have the potential to really change how we perceive the play if the production went balls figurative to the wall. admittedly this was my first babes with blades show but with a name that sexy i was expecting more blades. thats the most glaring issue with this  and  the lack of swashbuckling. the fights designed by libby beyreis are well executed and complicated but there are not enough of them. the swords only come out for the handful of times  writes them in. in that way even if the battles are impressive this is just like any other production. we come expecting babes and blades laduca should give the audience what they want and cram the staging with fighting. that could really make the play interesting what if the balcony scene involved some playful knifing? he and beyreis have the opportunity and audience go ahead to do some unconventional stuff but they never go for it. the all female cast was also mishandled. ricky luries costuming is great all the male characters wear skirts that imply trousers indicating the characters gender without masking that of the actors. laduca has the chance to do some interesting meta musing on gender politics in the centuries old story but he never makes a move. the male characters always stay male which made me wonder what the point was. you forget youre even watching an all women production. the idea seems good on paper there are enough gender issues to make a womens studies majors head spin for example if their love was ever discovered how well would  fare compared to ?. but a director needs to breathe life into a concept for it to actually connect to the audience and laduca just lets this one sit still. the period does not do much for me either even though laduca makes an impassioned argument for it in the program notes. the liberal period he contends was an especially high tension moment between the haves and have nots. historically the social trends of this time grew into the fascism that embroiled the world in war. as far as the s and s are concerned though the time period reboot only means different costumes. good intentions but again we dont get much more than a facade. so the concept may not stick but if you are looking for a solid well acted tribute to the bard this would be worth your time. the script cuts are somewhat blunt and some good stuff is lost in the name of a two hour running time. but the cast gives some decent performances and navigate the language surprisingly well for a storefront theatre company. gillian n. humiston and ashley fox as  and  respectively bring a believable youthful vigor to their roles. amy harmon as  and megan schemmel as  are also noteworthy having a great if sometimes over the top feisty energy. the real stand out of the production however is eleanor katz as the nurse who alternates between mousy and strong but always keep us with her. bill andersons set is two tons of fun. its simple and drab but works beautifully. the whole stage consists of several levels and throughways that work as a playground for the actors. laduca stages very well in the space always keeping our attention by using the different heights. but babes with blades is unable to make this decent production a great one. and honestly a decent production of a play so overdone is not needed. the company should have found inspiration in what makes them great spirited independent women conducting complex swordplay. theyve got a great idea but it needs to nurtured and allowed to mature. ,3,Tragedy,Negative
Romeo & Juliet,A Younger Romeo & Juliet,Christopher Adams,a large heart shaped arrangement of flowers dominates the stage and greets the audience as they enter the unicorns weston theatre. for pilot theatres production of  and  designed for everyone aged 11  the flowers are a shrine creating a sense of vigil and tragedy. the candles surrounding the stage are reminiscent of baz lurhmanns 1996 film also playing to a younger trendier audience. the production begins with lady  mary rose delivering the prologue a grief stricken mother. characters stand around her as the stage fog begins billowing and  crawls into a large square much like a television screen in the upper stage.  this is a modern day setting with actors in trendy dress converse skinny jeans zipper hoodies. chloe lamfords design involves a large background screen with color washes. a raked stage leads to a raised staging area on which are wooden beams some of them holding candles. in the center of the raised platform is a large square outlined in blue electric light. the square serves as s bedroom and later her funeral bier. given the choices by directors marcus romer and katie posner there are three things apparently that make this a production designed for a youthful audience stage fog background score and penisbreast jokes. to begin with the last first chris lindons  for instance cannot stop thrusting his pelvis. he employs some of the vegetation as a make shift phallus. if there is an opportunity to pelvic thrust shake some booty or imitate breasts pilots production takes it.  and  certainly contains much bawdy but the constant repetition becomes a bit dull though it sends titters through the pre pubescentpubescent audience. for all its pelvic thrusting the productions actual enactment of the   marriage night is tame where the lovers briefly lie on a bed of flowers before the lights cut out and reset to the next morning. in focusing so heavily pregnancy and sex pun on the sexual humor the production loses sight of romantic connection between the lead characters. sandy nuttgenss score provides background music through the show. the music initially drowns out the opening dialogue and occasionally distracts but it is mostly soft strings and piano. as  contemplates the potion from friar  a che guevara t shirt wearing richard james neale that will give her something like death the music pulses imitating the slow beating of a heart. as for the stage fog it is near constant and feels like a crutch for creating atmosphere. rachel spicers  is a convincing young teenager intoning sardonically. she like cleopatra is mercurial apt to change her mind frequently petulant. she tosses s lindon in a much more restrained doubling flowers aside and pays little attention to her mother. as she speaks of her love of  she gathers up an armful of flowers and cuddles them prompting a few ewws from some of the younger boys in the audience. spicer seems most at home in the emotional fury generated in the fight with her father  travis. travis does a solid job of pushing an emotionally safe production to uncomfortable territory prompting the realization of what is at stake and how much  has to lose.  wilsons  is something of a cipher with a touch of recitation about him. bryn holding is an endearing  often the literal butt of s jokes but he creates a sense of groundedness as this teenage dream becomes a nightmare. the production moves swiftly and fight director philip dorleans provides two gritty slash and cut knife fights. there is a tendency in the cast to accompany images in the text with a direct physical movement a way of concretely explaining the text. s you are a lover borrow cupids wings and soar with them becomes lindon holding a bouquet of flowers in either hand and flapping them while prancing along the stage. a more physically explanative production appears to hold the audiences attention a younger audience from the ages of ten or eleven to seventeen or eighteen. aided by spicers intelligent portrayal pilots production of  and  provides an engaging introduction to s text. but it suffers from too often taking the way of cheap thrills over creative direction. pilots production of  and  shows at the unicorn theatre london until february 12 2011. it tours cities in the uk until april 9 2011. for a list of tour places and dates click here.,3,Tragedy,Negative
Romeo & Juliet,Gorgeous Tragedy Rounds SF Ballet's 2010 Season,Denise Battista,helgi tomassons dramatically choreographed balletic version of  and  is far more tragic than s play but it translates rich in beauty. the san  ballet has the resources to portray tomassons vision captured by grand scale set designs picture perfect costumes dramatic lighting and a critically acclaimed company orchestra whose separate parts are equally as great as its whole. the san  ballet orchestra guided by martin west is heroically apt at delivering all the emotion darkness beauty and angst of sergei prokofievs star cd lovers. tomassons rj premiered at the sf ballet in 1994 and now returns to san s war memorial opera house to round out the ballets 2010 season. with two lengthy intermissions time flies in this two and a half hour production only adding to the sense of urgency in this tragic love story in which  and  meet love and die in a matter of days. this ballet is drama heavy with more than strong echoes of s play. jens jacob worsaaes lovely and sometimes referential costume design proves helpful when trying to gauge whos who during the beginning and ensemble pieces. colors are rich and bold layered with flowing hues. worsaaes set design is awe inspiring riding the waves of movement on the stage. scene changes are exciting yet smooth and greatly signified by the moving and multi level set design including stone facades arches and gilded pillars staircases and frescos and a walkway towering across the stage right to left. lighting is also dramatic and reable. thomas r. skelton combines the subtle and the bold in spots that enlighten s gorgeous distress as she sarah van patten battles with herself in the moments before drinking a sleeping potion. and like a foreboding yet mesmerizing sunset the backdrop transforms through all the colors of loves wound to the finality of deep and violent red.  and  lie dead  pierre françois vilanoba distraught and banishèd. martino pistones fight direction is a quandary. its well choreographed and s damian smith violent death is brutally memorable partly because of the drama smith brings to the scene but the swordplay lacks the raw and real elements captured throughout the rest of the production. vilanoba and van patten are youthful and raw and exactly what you want  and  to be. unlike s play s first love  here coyly portrayed by nutnaree pipit suksun is physically present in the first few scenes so we get to see s fickle heart as his eyes wander to . one cant help but notice the ed difference between the way  interacts with her  versus  quinn wharton and her parents  and his lady portrayed by val caniparoli and elana altman. again with  and  think raw uninhibited desperate and without the all the courtly rules and regulations enforced elsewhere. think love without any of the baggage of experience. drama aside there are bright spotlights of dance throughout. before entering the s masquerade   pascal molat and  hansuke yamamoto engage in a boisterous pas de trios with viable russian influences during which either yamamoto is a step behind or vilanoba and molat a step beyond. but the dance is an opportunity to introduce these principal males and showcase molats talent and his characters dynamic edge. your eyes will follow molat whether hes dancing with his own lusty interests harlots portrayed by courtney elizabeth and pauli magierek taunting the fiery  or breaking our hearts in his too soon death scene plaguing both houses before falling up the staircase. three acrobats dores andre benjamin stewart matthew stewart bring even more life to the already lively square and harlots elizabeth and magierek offer dichotomy with their sex driven moves and flying skirts bringing airs of west side to this story. but its  and  who grip our senses. vilanoba and van patten are like magnets at first sight. they poetically speak and kiss their first sonneted words in dance. their pas de deux in the gardenbalcony scene is as exciting as springtime  beautifully rash and sudden with added vigor from vilanoba. van patten brings her all to their morning after pas de deux the dance filled with angst desperation and passion. but its when she battles with herself in the moments before drinking the sleeping potion given her by the friar ricardo bustamante that van patten clinches the title of unforgettable. like an epiphany during which all the senses come together like a cyclone van patten delivers a frighteningly stunning performance. and their final moments in the tomb are heartbreaking.  tries and fails to make his lifeless  engage in one more dance and we gasp when  comes back to life a split second before her  vanishes into the next. but tragedy is multiplied on this stage. in s play we have a prologue two households both alike in dignity  and we have reconciliation in the end as  and  join hands. s play is the retelling of a tragedy. were prepared because of the prologue and were at least somewhat pacified in the end to know the civil war between the two houses has come to an end. this is not the case on tomassons stage. we begin in real time with the friar the first in focus as the square comes to life with townspeople. its as though were living in our own flash forward present yet with the knowledge of whats to come and theres not a thing we can do about it. and in the end there is no reconciliation of the families. sure we may impose our own hands considering how well we know the play but tomassons ballet ends in death. tomassons ballet is a

Romeo & Juliet,"For TSF's Gifted Players in Romeo and Juliet, the Verse is All",Cynthia Greenwood,in presenting the texas  festivals annual five show repertory artistic director raymond caldwell insists on bestowing audiences with a rare treat. whenever possible he casts classically trained actors who respect s verse. and in his current staging of  and  he has cast actors in the title roles who appear to be young teens just as  intended. this festivals creative team also imagines verona as  himself might have a rough renaissance era village where a blood feud between the  and  families imbues the air with prejudice and violence. in s opening scene two pairs of toughs start a brawl inciting prince  and his officers to invoke a heavy punishment for further disturbance of the peace. from this moment forward a pall is cast upon the citizens of verona. an aura of foreboding and suspense is ever present hovering in the air. in later scenes  skillfully undercuts this sense of doom with brilliant bawdy wit combat between  and  of the  family and their good friend  a kinsman of the prince veronas highest official. unfortunately director kevin otos seems reluctant to incorporate the shadow of doom in guiding the players during the productions first half. this is a vital element in building suspense toward the tragic outcome from the moment  and  embrace forbidden love. consequently early scenes such as the  ball come across as excessively bright and comic rendering them disappointingly flat. but in the shows second half this exceptional company delivers a much more cohesive and satisfying rendition of this beloved tragedy. replete with classical architecture and costumes faithful to the period this production is opulent in verbal artistry scenery and props. playgoers have grown as familiar with  and s speeches as they have with s soliloquies. this can be a blessing and a curse. although presenters revel in  and s box office appeal the plays popularity challenges directors to keep the story fresh and immediate for each new audience. with some exceptions this companys careful attention to the verse offers listeners an opportunity to experience certain well known speeches in a fresh light and hear less familiar lines with impressive clarity. a notable example of this comes through in the performance of . playing s sidekick and a de facto peacemaker actor j. hernandez displays exceptional mastery in his command of the roles gravity and humor. hernandez is equally impressive in the companys production of loves labours lost. as  mary candlers graceful mellifluous verse does great justice to this historic role and the plays most important character. in s first scene involving her mother lady  and the nurse her loyal guardian candler balances respect for both women with an honesty that serves her well when she faces the unwelcome prospect of arranged marriage and the emotional challenges of true love loss and ultimately escape through suicide. as s loquacious nurse meaghan sullivan willis opens strongly in the signature come lammas eve speech that occurs in the plays third scene. overall the actors comic timing and knack for delivering bawdiness is well developed. in creating this uniquely an comic portrait sullivan willis presents a keen contrast to the young woman who will soon outgrow the need for her advice and counsel. this actors performance as the maid dorine in tsfs tartuffe is even stronger and more nuanced perhaps as a result of a different directors approach. as the electric  aaron white conveys tremendous intensity although his tendency to telegraph the lascivious meanings in his queen mab speech is not to this reviewers taste. nonetheless white possesses an imaginative sense of s energy and he entertains well in spite of distracting unnecessary gestures.  hutcheson is undoubtedly regal as  the prince of verona and has been a hall of this company for two seasons in a row. in spite of his eagerness to walk when standing still would suffice kevin barber delivers a measured performance as friar . caroline crocker provides a portrait of lady  that is gentle nuanced and authoritative. ian christiansens  the noble who is promised to  by her father is well executed. in less impressive moments this company which is capable of soaring like a finely tuned stradivarius sounds off key and bereft of careful direction. ben s  appears solid in early scenes but he begins to lose his sense of purpose as the play progresses. in s signature balcony scene which occurs after he has crashed lord s masque and fallen in love with   injects his lines with gratuitous humor and a sardonic tone that is wholly inappropriate. in later scenes his performance could be improved by more thoughtful direction. on the whole the director might place greater faith in the ability of  and the others to deliver their lines while standing still. film buffs familiar with the 1978 bbc tv adaptation of this play will appreciate tsfs loyalty to authentic period costume and the scenery of renaissance verona. jesse dreikosens scenes and val winkelmans gorgeous wardrobes enhance this staging enormously. the lighting design of tony galaska also should be commended. by the third act these visuals and the players ability to tone down the movement and gesturing allow this sad beautiful tale to unfold into a double suicide of honest and powerful intensity.,4,Tragedy,Positive
Romeo & Juliet,Two Star-Crossed Lovers and a Lot of Blood,Denise Battista, and  is by all means a tragedy.  and  is by all means a love story. the trick is portraying the play as by all means both. the tragedy in  and  is not so much that the lovers die but that their fates are outside of their control perhaps firstly because they are star cd but also because they are children trying to live an adult life without proper guidance and because they are never permitted the opportunity to openly experience the great journey of falling and being in love with each other. this play is different from the other love speckled tragedies  had and lost his  cleopatra had and lost her . even  could be added to this shortlist of love tragedies because in each of these plays there is also some outside force independent of the lovers that dooms them from the start.  and  had and lost they never had a chance and they were children at the mercy of the adults in the play. even if  and  had not been slain  and  would have been kept apart by that ever elusive ancient grudge between their families. the only thing that we hope ends that grudge is  and s death hardly consolation for what could have been. jonathan moscone sets this popular play in the modern day with a focus on the violence of our time.  unfortunately it seems violence in this production means the overt use of too many blood pellets which effectively direct attention away from the concept and pangs of tragedy and focus it on the actors ability to effectively squeeze aim and squirt. i seem to remember this as an issue in cal shakes 2007 production of king lear directed by lisa son. there too the tragedy and emotion was too often lost in a spray of bloody absurdity. a modern day play calls for modern day dress. this makes sense but raquel m. barretos costume design hardly dazzles. these kids wear exactly what youd see in any american high school tee shirts and hoodies  sports a pair of joes jeans  a leather jacket the brightly colored party dresses while very pretty would be popular at any local sophomore dance.  the s are more formally and showily dressed than the s with both  craig er and  liam vincent following in three piece suit. neil patels set design is sparse but makes a bold statement working with russell h. champas brilliant lighting design of pinks and purples and then tragic reds casting expertly staged shadows on the walls. a large statue of the virgin mary and baby jesus on one side of the stage stands idle as s bed lays idol on the other. theres a staircase upstage escalating left to right and the backdrop is painted with dramatic graffiti. the staircase permits exits and entrances from above but also helps the already charming balcony scene between our star cd lovers as alex morf  conjures loves light wings as he oerperches the virgin mary in order to reach the stairway to the goddess of his idolatry. morf and sarah nealis as  never touch during the balcony scene. the stairs to window ratio places them just out of arms reach and this works to create a sweetness between the two that in later scenes is somewhat soured. the set design tosses out all kinds of analogies between life and death creation and creationism idolatry false and not and the blurry lines that connect them all. while morf is a fine enough actor hes a tough fit for . lines are spoken and only sometimes felt and the connection we need with  and he needs with  is somehow never achieved. morfs  is young emotional sensitive and his cracking voice is a nice although unintentional i think touch but his  is about as exciting and passionate as the costume design. nealis on the other hand is charming and sweet and beautiful and in need of a  to match her and raise her up on this stage. choreographer marybeth cavanaughs measured and boisterous dance scene is a treat and somewhat reminiscent of the passionate dancing in west side story with the colorful dresses spinning and the group choreography entrancing the audience. and andre pluess fresh off  santa cruzs 2008 production of  and  has created yet another great score of music wavering throughout between explosive passion and sometimes discord versus the tender simplicity of a few notes on the right side of the piano to underscore the painful tenderness and sweetness of young love. the fire that keeps this production burning comes from jud williford as  but remember we tragically lose  at the beginning of act 3. williford is troubled wields a bottle of jack and a switchblade delivers his version of queen mab in a shell shocked fury of comedy angst and anger and dies a death that will perhaps bring the only tears to your eyes in this production about  and . he need not ride in on a vespa with  thomas azar to make a grand entrance. williford is a star and his characters death is a stinging blow to this production. but there are other good performances. l.  callender doubles as the apothecary and the scene is poignant because callender is just that good but mostly because of the staging that places callender in the same balcony window where  called for her . julian lopez morillas as the prince is a force to be reckoned with and with as much potency as he brings to the part one wonders how verona ever spiraled out of his control. s james carpenter and julie eccles provide the essence of violence in this play more than blood pellets ever could. this ancient grudge whatever it is  is the cause. what we see onstage is the effect. along the way there is the idea that anger begets anger violence begets violence and carpenter is perfect in his role as the father who never listens but screams to be heard. the anger between the s and the s l.  callender and catherine castellanos respectively and within each family is violent and fiery and only teaches  and  to act just as impetuously as their parents. this generational terror is the true message of violence in the play or at least it should take precedence over the blood pellets. and while  and  cant count on their parents to understand they look to the friar and the nurse for guidance. castellanos doubles as s nurse and while im a huge fan of this actress castellanos doesnt go far enough or speak clearly enough in her role as nurse. she tries to be funny and over the top but the comedy is more motion than motivated. her portrayal is predictable and sometimes forgettable. dan hiatt as friar  is good but is most memorable in the last few moments of the play when the ideally teary eyed focus of the audience should be on the dead lovers behind him. so while the focus is somewhat off and blurred by blood that would have been more suitable for one of last seasons many productions of  its tough to pardon this show without punishment. with as much talent on and behind this stage its bloody absurdity to have a seated audience at the end the show.,3,Tragedy,Negative
Romeo & Juliet,Two Lovers: Too Innocent,Claudine Nightingale,once again the season at the globe begins this time with one of the most performed of s oeuvre. an obvious choice under this seasons theme young hearts dominic dromgoole directs this traditional production of  and  as part of his fourth season as the globes artistic director. one of the most commented upon aspects of dromgooles directorial approach is the youthfulness of the cast. for once  ellie kendrick looks refreshingly as though she may just be as young as not yet fourteen. the friar rawiri paratene and nurse penny layden are also much younger than they are normally portrayed the cumulative effect creating the potential for enormous energy and vibrancy on stage. although this is kendricks theatrical debut she has made a name for herself in recent times in the uk at least through her portrayal of anne frank in the bbcs the diary of anne frank. having thoroughly enjoyed the television series i was eager to see her as  but i was unfortunately met with disappointment. the eighteen year old actress who performs in this role as part of her gap year before going to read english literature at cambridge this september looks the perfect part youthful and innocent and restrained by the propriety of her rich italian family. i eagerly waited to see her passion and excitement in love unfold but sadly it never really happened. kendricks restraint and her preoccupation with the inflections of the text consequently mean that we never really believe in the idea that she is swept up in any sort of amorous feelings for .  adetomiwa edun thankfully shows much more youthful admiration and living delight in . yet because of the continued emphasis on the couples innocence even when they are together on stage we have no sense of any chemistry between them. that painfully said there is much to commend in this production. directors are often fearful of presenting a straight traditional  and . because it is performed so frequently they feel the need to inflict some directorial spin on the events. in a qa session with the director and some of the actors after the show dromgoole explained the joy of directing in the globe is you can just do the play. you dont need to do anything with it you just do the play and let the words speak for themselves. this is instantly and visibly noticeable as you enter the space designed by simon daw. for the first time in years there is no stage protruding at bizarre angles into the groudlings space. the joy in  and  and thankfully for dromgoole is the beauty of the text itself. the words have everything from the melting love poetry of the lovers to the sprightly and endearing wit of . the words are very much the focus and dromgoole ensures they shine through and work their own magic. and while there is a lack of any sort of passion between the lovers we discover some other hidden treasures in the meantime. the ever jovial philip cumbus portrays a captivating  mixing the golden material with fantastic comic timing. similarly minor roles such as  one of the many roles played by fergal mcelherron become something of a delight adored by the audience and bawdily entertaining. credit must also go to iain redford for his utterly commanding performance as  so powerful was his portrayal the audience was compelled into spontaneous applause after one particularly rousing speech. this in itself makes it a show worth seeing although i find it hard to disguise my disappointment in the lack of passion between these two youths. this production does offer some refreshingly insightful hilarity and theatrical potential in the more minor roles. it also easily matches the globes impressive standards with its renaissance costume design simon daw persuasive performances on the minor whole and sublime music sung by four of the actors and composed by the inimitable nigel hess. this all combines to create a worthwhile evening out assuming your focal point in  and  is not  and .,3,Tragedy,Negative
Romeo & Juliet,Uptempo Action for Romeo and Juliet,Ina Rometsch,does the thought of s  singing karaoke make you cringe? dont say so before youve seen it for miraculously in the declan s theatres los angeles production of  and  this gimmick works. rather than just creating silliness the scene proves to be a foil for what is to happen in the course of the play. the karaoke takes place in the first act as  and  meet for the very first time. when it is s turn he sings strangers in the night unknowingly anticipating the driving force of the tragedy that is about to unfold lovers at first sight in love forever.not all added elements in this production work quite as smoothly. the program informs the audience that the feuding families of the star cd lovers will be represented as modern day americans. s family the s is depicted as liberal catholics with s folks the s as conservative evangelical christians.on the one hand this nicely refers to the playwrights experience in elizabethan england when the kingdom was deeply divided by religious beliefs. but on the other hand this modern day setting turns out to be confusing. it is hard to accept the premise of watching modern americans when the play is explicitly set in verona italy with a prince as a ruler. also seeing people who are allegedly 21st century liberal catholics and evangelicals draw their knives in a fight just seems weird.luckily these problems turn out to be not such a big deal. there is an easy solution to the dilemma they create for the viewer ignore the directors note in the program forget about the liberalevangelical angle and concentrate on what is happening on stage. there s play gets an enthusiastic and lively rendition. the minimalistic set in which black boxes stand in for balcony bed and tomb alike lets s words transcend time and place.erwin tuazon gives a charismatic  and leigh dunhams  is chatty and sweet   yet her performance is full of surprising nuances. an aggressive high energy  jeff holden adds suspense and oomph. the decision to cast a female actor as his sidekick  jennifer oakley lets some erotic sparks fly for  constantly and amusingly tries to come on to her. equally unfulfilled remain the desires of the sexually underemployed nurse tiffany ann price. unfortunately she looks young enough to be s sister but she makes up for the sub optimal casting with her comic talent.the production suffers from the mixed abilities of the cast and some fumbled lines. after the intermission with the energetic  dead and the cute  dream team separated the show meanders through a lamentable dry spell but thanks to jeff hirbours direction the slack picks up again. he delivers a mostly well paced staging and makes clever use of the venue. the next stage theatre is a tiny space in a hollywood strip mall. hirbour deals with its architectural limitations by letting his actors enter and run at full speed through the area where the audience is seated creating uptempo action among the viewers. the production also makes smart use of music in the transitions between the scenes with sound cuts keeping up the pace and setting the mood getting more and more melancholic over time.in the end first time director hirbours approach of declaring s feuding families to be modern day americans is not convincing but unwittingly his production shows that  and  does not need to be transported into a contemporary framework to provide a timely commentary on intolerance hatred and the power of love.,3,Tragedy,Negative
Romeo & Juliet,Romeo and Juliet Transcend Vanity,Jack Morgan,o so light a footwill neer wear out the everlasting flint.a lover may bestride the gossamerthat idles in the wanton summer airand yet not fall so light is vanity.the thing that most people will talk about regarding soviet dramatist sergei radlovs original story concept and homage to    is that the title characters live happily ever after. purists might not be able to stomach the lovers survival but this is no show for purists and im not sure there ever was a show purists could enjoy. if you cant enjoy  morris dance groups  and  on motifs of  im not sure you can enjoy anything. something like this is hard to pull off vying to be an iconoclast but thats exactly what director and choreographer  morris does with his west coast premiere of rj motifs. the dancers embody their characters in ways that actors simply cant and what transpires is a whole new experience of a story that everyone already thinks they know. but if you think you know the story think again.the show starts with a fray but this time the towns women are in the fight and even though  dallas mcmurray and s julie worden sword fight is more dance than battle the fray is somehow more brutally violent. prokofievs music accentuates the dancers motions to the point that when  bites his thumb its shocking for the first time ever. the berkeley symphony orchestra conducted by stefan asbury deserves the standing ovation the audience offered because they brought the music the soviet adaptation and the playwright to life.the gestures between the clans backed up by the orchestra keep them from being lost in history as quaint insults of antiquity. the fight is broken up by a prince joe bowie whose strong presence and stern approach is offset by his calming hands. he embodies the ultimate prince whose word is feared but whose rule is soft and steady. again the orchestra comes in handy here horns and drums and volume when the prince points at and scolds each parental  and  guillermo resto teri weksler and shawn gannon megan s while quietly plaintive strings urge them to still their cankered hands of hate.the ubiquitous nurse lauren grant is still the best part in the play. here she is the smallest person on stage but she has the biggest presence. she is elfish enough to seem magical and mischievous and she is a welcome addition to any scene. grant is hilarious without being too much of a clown and she does more for the character with dance than most actors have been able to do with speech. its incredible to see the nurse expressing herself through dance. shes a complicated one and grant does an impeccable job.another show stealer is . i am always surprised when i meet a  i like and i loved this one. amber darrach a beautiful woman plays a man so well that disbelief is not only suspended but eliminated.  laughs and taunts and does all the things he normally does but at the masque he also provides precedence for his anger with  and his bawd scene with the nurse. he disrupts the order everyone else wants and dances in the face of everyone elses plans. there are a lot of plans in    and  touches them all. i never say bravo but bravo amber darrach. maile okamura enters and she is the only  i have ever seen who is as light as gossamer. okamura floats onto the stage with all the innocence of a child into a scene where her nurse and her mother show her how to be a woman. its a sweetly clumsy moment and it sets in motion a motif that manages to gracefully age  throughout the performance. she matures and becomes a woman by the end of the show and it is reable. she goes from a girl who is pushed around and guided by her parents and  brandon mcdonald at the masque to a young woman owning her sexuality and autonomy during the bedroom scene and faux suicide. rather than be cut off by death we are in awe as we behold  blossoming into a grown woman who has found her true love. okamuras  is dynamic and leaves the audience truly wanting to see her make it out of the play alive.throughout the production okamuras distance from  is palpable like it is in traditional stagings of the play which is surprising since the balcony scene is a dance number between  and . the lovers share the stage perhaps more than the play calls for but morris doesnt undermine . during the masque there are so many people on the stage blocking  and  from one another that its a relief when they finally touch and  kisses her palm. the balcony scene is peppered by the urgency of their situation and s reluctance to leave as the nurse keeps interrupting them. the bedroom scene is deliciously romantic but the light from stage left the sun rising brings a new day of doom on  and pulls him from her. only in the very end when you think the show is over and the curtain rises one last time like clouds after a storm do the lovers seem really together.  and  are dancing in heaven the lights are still on but the stage has completely changed. stars are now on all the walls. their dance is a little awkward at first. no one has seen the lovers survive and all of the doubt inherent in young love and marriage tugs somewhere. but the number becomes more fluent and touching and before you know it the stars are shining brightly and the lovers look like they are dancing in the sky like we have all been transported to someplace more beautiful and forgiving than this world a place where  and his  orbit around each other like magnets drawn together for an eternity. this is the image as the final curtain falls.scenic designer allen moyer provides the dancers with enough room to tell the story while establishing location. truly impressive. this is probably also due to james f. ingalls lighting design which directs our eyes to the action and sheds light on the concepts of time and space and place be it dawn or dusk the house of  or the streets of verona the beginning or the end or in this case the beginning again.,5,Tragedy,Positive
Romeo & Juliet,Romeo and Juliet on a Gender Bender,Georgina Petronella,its funny how a male  can seem like a bold innovation when an all male casting is the most traditional way of mounting . after all in the bards time women were not permitted to act and so all the female roles were performed by boys. the worry today of course is that such a casting move can seem gimmicky. fortunately the  theatres engrossing  and  ably straddles the line between tradition and innovation and between male and female if you humbly will. the production takes off with a twist from the very beginning. the actors jointly recite a prologue in their dresses but without their wigs as if to emphasize that they are men and this is a play and we all must play along if we are going to believe. then the wigs are donned and the play begins in earnest. and once the initial giggles subside it becomes apparent that this is no mere drag show.  and  is however deeply interested in gender. the old friar continually scolds  for his feminine traits thy tears are womanish while  is upbraided for her male? independence. the s and s view the world in black and white you can be male or female but youd better not be both. but as the night goes on and as the men successfully embody women the casting starts to undercut the text in us ways. and yet at other times the casting is very much in synch with the characters. when we meet  she seems caught right on the cusp between ugly duckling and swanhood. she has bee stung lips a deep but not unpleasant voice and far too many hands and feet. the mixture is thoroughly endearing.  is rarely played by a teenager but having a gangly young dude play her may be the next most authentic choice.  is thirteen she should be uncomfortable and coltish in her newly sprouted body. james davis as our lanky  is matched in likeability by finn wittrock as . boyishly handsome with a glossy mop of hair wittrock is natural and sweet as the worlds most famous doomed lover. he captures a certain kind of adolescent the type of kid who patiently puts up with a scolding because he is thoroughly used to it and confident that he will be loved despite. the other standout in the cast is drew eshelman as s nurse. here again the male casting adds something. the boys of verona view the nurse as an asexual old beast so having a man embody her plays with her already established androgyny. moreover eshelman successfully conveys that this old hag of a nurse cares deeply for .  has a surrogate parent as well in his friar. the real parents of both teenagers are cold and distant. feuding for so long has not done their dispositions any favors. as played by washington d.c. stalwart ted van griethuysen the deliberate and thoughtful old friar quickly captures our sympathy. aubrey deeker as the manic  also exhibits considerable charisma and energy. really the whole cast is strong and strongly committed to both the story and the gender device. i often forgot that i was watching men play women. even the ensemble players take their roles as maids etc seriously never straying into caricature or farce. the production the first in the harman hall to be staged in a thrust configuration is handsomely mounted. the set by scott bradley features an italian courtyard and these cool metal rings that the  boys swing on like monkeys. the period costumes by jennifer moeller are ornate and gorgeous although i dont understand why all of the shirts had holes cut out of them at the armpit. david muse the director keeps a sure hand on all the action seamlessly transitioning us from scene to scene and from mood to mood. as a whole this strikes me as a well thought out production. muse for example has wisely told his  not to bother with a falsetto. he rightly understands that an audience needs to comprehend the language more than we need to hear a feminine voice. in a nutshell thats probably why this production works as well as it does. gender although important plays second fiddle to the characters themselves.,4,Tragedy,Positive
Romeo & Juliet,"Provocative, Unadulterated Romeo and Juliet to the Extreme",Denise Battista,about a million hyperbolous years ago a grad school professor i was assisting told me that one of the great tragedies in  and  is the fact that the adults in the play fail the children everyone from parents to nurse friars to prince the adults neither listen to nor take the children in the play seriously. he was also the first professor to take and teach the lovers plight with some import. since then ive been searching for a staging that does the same. until now both  and  have been presented to me as spoiled juvenile or whiny stomping round the stage adolescents. their story has been littered with condescending images of puppy love and teenage growing pains. for anyone whos ever felt the pangs of love let alone love that is forbidden the emotions involved run deep even on a good day. in director kim rubinsteins production of  and  staged by  santa cruz in the midst of the sinsheimer stanley festival glen redwoods ive finally found what ive been looking for all these years. rubinstein calls upon her hungarian heritage setting our lovers in a fabled budapest complete with gypsies musicians and fortune tellers in order to underscore this plays theme of exile. set designer erhard rom places  in a more traditional well to do hungarian household the stage set with a flowered balcony above the pillared floor. scaffold stairways left and right are connected by a thoroughfare on which our lovers will embrace in a most tender moment and most passionate kiss the kind of kiss that leaves your foreheads touching as your mouths come up for air. youll follow  and his lost boys into the forest stage right in which s tree house is planted in the middle of several towering redwoods a studio slum with makeshift wind chimes a metal bucket a bird cage and a single red rose hanging without. the rest of the forest glen not occupied by the audience is overrun by s swashbuckling gypsy cronies led by stephen bel davies whose  is exciting provocative and every bit as mercurial as he should be. adolescence is not ruled out of this production. that would be just plain silly. we meet  in a pair of converse dancing by herself as though no one is looking. caitlin fitzgerald is playful thoughtful innocent and naïve without being unsophisticated. she carries a natural beauty with a freedom that requires no time in hair and make up and rawness in her acting that enchants with believability. theres a sense that up until now  has not had a care in the world perhaps a deduction made after watching her nurse saundra mcclain with the help but mostly observation of lady  yvonne woods perform s daily grooming for her. the casually staged scene is hysterical as the limp and ragdollish fitzgerald sits in her chair center stage while mcclain shaves young s legs brushes her teeth and so on. this proves almost as funny and odd as fitzgeralds perfectly awkward karaoke of dream a little dream complete with back up singers to kick off the masquerade. and our dark and melancholic  goes through all the moans and groans you would expect over the fair  yet  pasternak has a bad boy edge thats daring and fearless and sexy as hell as well as an excellently imposed brit boy accent leaving me shocked to read pasternak hails from la. pasternak and fitzgerald are electrifying. they are  and  in the most desperate and beautiful way. andre pluess has created a sweet and tender piece of music that accompanies the lovers throughout the production composed of the melodic line of a violin with a piano playing a simple arpeggiated chord think variation on the first movement of beethovens moonlight sonata. when pasternak and fitzgeralds eyes meet for the first time the action on the stage around them slows in motion creating a moment in time. pluess accompaniment creates the same affect over and over again. as s nurse mcclain is hearty and endearing a storyteller and a fortuneteller hailing from some gypsy clan before coming to the  household with a pipe in her hand and a flask in her pocket. mcclain is accompanied by mick mize as  who has a stool strapped to his back and has finagled a way to permit those he encounters to sit on the stool without undoing it from his back. the trick is genius and hysterical as is mize in his clownish role. as  relies on her nurse for comfort and guidance  looks to friar laurence richard farrell who dressed in a beaded vest with sandaled feet picks through the herbs hes gathered for the day. mcclain and farrell open the play by speaking the prologue to the audience. they press the young and lusty lovers through the rituals of their marriage ceremony without considering and enforcing the repercussions of the action. they fail  and  in their time of need and take the brunt of the blame in the end as they stand around the dead lovers in their eternal embrace. we dont see much of s parents which is telling in itself. lord and lady  played by  pribyl and yvonne woods are quick and severe in their encounters with  woods a society woman in a tailored ruby red suit on her lean statuesque form a piled high tight bun and perfect makeup that never cracks with emotion. to her lack of emotion pribyl is fiery and explosive and even abusive to his disobeying daughter. neither are good listeners. much like  had to kill off falstaff in order to make way for king henry v we must lose  in order hand the spotlight and the tragic ending to  and . bel davies makes this a tough torch to pass. bel davies along with ross crain grayson dejesus and  schroeder make up s hell raising and swaggering gypsy band of friends im not forgetting about  but more on that later their perfect bodies clad in low rise tight fitting and belted pants skimpy and backless vests no shirts looking like a cross between gypsy and pirate. bel davies is a standout. his voice has a biting and sarcastic tone and his antics are mesmerizing if not flamboyant right down to the way he stands on the stage. the name  stems from the word mercurial accounting for his quick wit but also for his volatile changing and erratic behavior. many times bel davies will stand in silence slightly off from the rest in a moment of deep and troubling thought and then quickly snap into his comedic and sharp tongued role. his personality disorder leads to his excellently staged duel with the fiery  david arrow and his death scene is even more heartbreaking as it is executed within sight of the audience. were even permitted time to mourn his loss as his lifeless body remains in view during the brutal even exaggerated slaying of  and the banishment of . the sense of extremes permeates this production with rubinstein calling up the gypsy notion of sevdah which she explains is an orgiastic celebration a state of extreme exaltation and deep sadness at the same time wildly expressed through dancing shouting breaking bottles the spilling of blood  and in its most extreme form suicide. just as s love is as boundless as the sea other actions and emotions are just as extreme and left unmoderated. though not necessarily miscast jon gentry as  seems to be misdirected. perhaps the point is to express how poor a match  is for  but gentrys weak presence and booty dance during the s masquerade seems a distracting misstep toward unnecessary and forced comedy. it also makes poor gentry a standout to the other extreme as the rest of the cast are perfectly on point. ive never really given much thought to s cousin  but this production has changed all that leading me to reread the play with him in mind. erik hellman portrays  as the only voice of reason in the play. the text accounts for this with  acting sort of like s  by recapping events as well as offering advice to . he is also the only character in the play with which  talks seriously.  listens. hellman is part of s crew but he looks and dresses differently and is the least volatile and the most reasonable character on stage. in s text  exits the play after explaining how it is  and  are slain. in this production he returns. after  and s heartbreaking and anxiety inducing death scene hellmen can be seen in a glowing spotlight sitting in the cradling branches of the redwoods surrounding s treehouse. he holds his knees in silence but his face is burdened and in despair. this interpretation adds depth and longevity to a production we all know cast with characters who have defined roles and endings. here  remains the most provocative of the bunch. so im thrilled to have after all these years found the production ive been searching for and so much more. maybe its a santa cruz thing as that professor bruce avery way back when received his ph.d. at ucsc during his own million hyperbolous years ago. speaking of nostalgia i cant help but believe that this productions little bit of added panache comes by way of sscs new artistic director marco barricelli. many of you know barricelli from his eight seasons with san s american conservatory theatre. some go back a little farther and followed him through his eight seasons at the oregon  festival. his professional career is expansive with barricelli wearing many different hats for acting directing and teaching over his twenty plus years in theatre. i began my one sided love affair only two years ago when i saw him play cyrano in a one season rave review return to osf in 2006. he and his white plume remain unforgettable. look for the white plume in this

Romeo & Juliet,Romance Blossoms in Regent's Park,Claudine Nightingale,a dramatic opening to the play sees a slightly ironic influence by west side story as the rival families emerge in 50s dress carefully choreographed in slow motion. the prologue is split between cast members yet it isnt all that effective and feels a little juvenile in comon to the sophistication of the opening scenes choreography mastered by liam steel. one amazing aspect of this theatrical space is its mysterious ability to stimulate all of the senses. this is something particular to the open air theatre. this impact on the senses leaves images engraved in the mind. case in point is the incense used to escort the seemingly dead  to the s tomb. the scent travels into the audience and beckons us into the scene. sumptuous costumes especially at the s masquerade ball brighten up the stage and offer further amusement for the audience with the s sizeable codpieces. the live singing during the ball is effective to a point but when the fated moment of  and s first meeting is presented at the front of the stage the music and dancing in the background is a little too overpowering and become a distraction from what ought to be the focal point. this happens again as the nurse sings in the background whilst  and  are in conversation. the balcony scene is a romantic masterpiece like melted toffee the poetry flows mellifluously between nicholas shaw and laura donnelly. wisely director timothy sheader leaves the 1950s influence out at this point. the scene ends with  walking into the auditorium giddy with love. there across the audience they hold their gaze ecstatic with affection and unable to leave each others sight. the result is heart warming and truly effective. oscar pearce offers an astounding performance as . he has such presence onstage and truly makes this role his own full of the confident cock sure vivacity of this attractive bad boy character. when the fight scene begins in which  is slain i could barely watch desperately wishing he would not die wanting to see more. the deaths themselves however are brilliantly executed with effective bleeding and a gruesome slit of s ben joiner throat provoking sounds of horror from many in the audience. a wonderfully romantic evening of entertainment this production portrays particularly well the naivety and intensity of these young lovers. though the production makes their tender ages very clear it also well illustrates the overwhelming depth of their intense passion for each other. aside from the emotional rollercoaster i left desperately wishing i could have a best friend like pearces  far and away the best performance of the night.,4,Tragedy,Positive
Romeo & Juliet,TheatreRats Reinvent Romeo and Juliet to a Hip-Hop Soundtrack,Liz Kimberlin,admittedly i was a bit apprehensive about attending this re invention of  and  since i am not a fan of rap or hip hop two musical motifs which figure prominently in the production. but i walked away from the performance very pleasantly surprised. director alexis m. hadsall does a terrific job of merging s timeless love story with an original contemporary urban score that leaves us with no doubt as to when or where we are from the time the lights go up until the final curtain. this  and  is set in new york city 2008 where our  is a dominican hottie from inwoodwashington heights a still predominantly hispanic neighborhood at the very top of manhattan and our  is a rich pretty somewhat bratty white girl from the upper east side. s original text is substantially abbreviated for this production but with the major exception of s scenes and especially his death this is a good thing. the story moves forward in a pulse and rhythm that reflects its musical backdrop and maintains the upbeat celebratory spirit that hadsall intends without bogging too far down in the tragedy or worse the ad nauseam monologues that would be inappropriate for a show of this nature. nothing is lost in the plot in fact it may in its way even be a bit improved with the emphasis on action. the medicine show theater where this production plays is a relatively small black box space with technical limitations. despite that lighting and set designer duane pagano has built a nifty little two tiered upstage platform that really could be used more imaginatively in the staging than it is. the dress is standard nyc street casual but costume designers melissa kraus and emily taradash show a delightful flare with the toga outfits for the party at the s. fight choreographer ryan bartruffs knife duel scenes are beautifully staged and truly unnerving especially since it appears that the actors are using real switchblades. the original music score comes from recording artists 2tru dynasty greyhound racial tension and duwende. most of the music is used in the background or during set changes but some also gets featured as part of the action. dance scenes are choreographed by elia monte brown. here s cohort  is a tough young black woman referred to as she and s doting nurse is a very out flamboyantly gay man referred to as he. both of these casting choices work marvelously well.  is played by the talented very buff brandi rhomes scene stealer  schuyler plays the nurse with a special nod to his parasol. walter brandes is splendid as the hate obsessed  as is michael kevin darnall playing the loyal but conflicted . other fine performances come from cedric jones as the resourceful friar  and rachel mcphee as a miserable alcoholic lady . for the most part francis mateo makes a wonderful believable  but alas hes hampered by playing to a  with whom he has very little chemistry or connection. caitlin davies who plays  is lovely and shes amusing in the scene when  throws an adolescent tantrum. but somehow davies is not in touch with this shows rhythm and just doesnt seem to be in the same production as everyone else nor does she seem comfortable with the text. fortunately the balcony scene which could have been a train wreck is wisely pared to a bare minimum. on the other hand most of s scenes have been radically cut and some are missing altogether. presumably this is in the interest of time but its also at the expense of a good actor as i would have liked to have seen more of joe kurtz. to a further degree its an expense to the show because with all the cuts unless somehow i missed something there is now no reasonable explanation as to why  suddenly wants to be at s grave or why  is so compelled to kill him. according to its literature the aim of the theatrerats troupe is to reinvigorate a sense of community among artists in new york and produce contemporary re inventions of plays written before 1900. despite the aforementioned comments about an out of sync leading lady and some overly ruthless text cuts this  and  is an ambitious very enjoyable show thats accessible to a youthful 21st century audience and a production of which this five year old company can be proud.,4,Tragedy,Positive
Romeo & Juliet,Romeo and Juliet Break Some Long-Overdue Barriers,Liz Kimberlin,productions like this are the best examples of why live theatre so deservedly continues to endure and thrive and how such risk taking can redefine the parameters of future envelopes to be pushed. this show is also the perfect antidote for those of us who suffer from  and  burn out syndrome i.e. we who get physically ill at the prospect of sitting through yet another heartfelt what light through yonder window breaks. theater breaking through barrierss take on  and  directed by ike schambelan includes every character every scene and presumably every word of s text. what makes this production different not to mention often exhilarating is there are only four actors three men one woman to perform the entire show in two hours with no intermission and at least two of the actors have a physical disability. theatre breaking through barriers or tbtb has been around almost 30 years but formerly under their more familiar name theater by the blind also tbtb which according to its literature was created in 1979 to develop blind and low vision talent for theater television and film. the name was recently changed in order to embrace and include all theatre artists with some form of disability. in this  and  gregg mozgala who primarily plays  but also several others has cerebral palsy. given mozgalas considerable talent charisma and impressive litheness in a role staged to be physically challenging for just about anybody his tics are easily assimilated into the character and then quickly become invisible. co artistic director and original tbtb company member george ashiotis on stage most memorably as nurse is apparently blind which i did not know until later after the show when i finally read the program notes. if the other two actors emily young  and nicholas viselli  have any physical impairment its not noticeable except possibly that wig for s teenage big hair which is endearingly ghastly. this is definitely not a production for anyone who wants a good cry over the traditional tragedy of  and . this is frankly anti rj a gimmicks based show played mostly for laughs and it pretty much succeeds spectacularly to that end. but because of its faithfulness to the text when those hormonally impassioned monologues rear their interminable heads its hard to take them seriously and easy to start getting a little restless. the same can be said for the death scenes. s and s demises are staged more traditionally if not plausibly by fight director j. david brimmer but you can see the joke set up in s death scene coming from a mile away. its still funny when it happens but its not entirely clear if its supposed to be. however apart from the fact that there is no intermission thats the end of the minus points. everything else is a great big plus and the time just flies by. this production is set in new york city 2007 and the wonderfully off beat costuming by chloe chapin is contemporary and extremely versatile making the many quick changes in this performance half the fun. the text is beautifully delivered by all four performers and schambelan keeps the action moving as quickly as a classic marx brothers movie. a special nod must go to ms. young who also portrays  for her alcoholic and street jaded rendition of the queen mab monologue and for succeeding in actually making it relevant to the play. even more impressive is her portrayal of  in a hilariously practical and gush free balcony scene. apart from it being more palatable its also a more accurate representation of a smart but confused 14 year old girls dilemma than the lite fm blithering love duet with which most of us are probably now associated. ashiotis takes on the roles of both nurse and friar with scenes that are for the most part delivered as offstage voices although ashiotis wanders in and out every few seconds dressed in sedate priestly garb for a line or two and then returns in his nurses polyester steel magnolia outfit from hell. because of designer bert scotts reable multi level set young amazingly is able to be present onstage but bounce back and forth with minimal costume change in the church scene during which  rejects her suitor   whom young also portrays. in his secondary principal role mozgala is a riot as lady  with costuming that proves just as hilarious. the only actor who doesnt get to do any gender bending this time around is nicholas viselli whose principal characters are  and s father lord . viselli quite shines in the latter role playing bipolar s seemingly benign surface to the hilt with a laidback texas oil baron drawl until grief at s death and s refusal to marry  sends him into a shocking and brutal rage. in the program notes schambelan points out that  in his early career only had about four actors to work with until an actual physical venue in london was established. cast size grew as the theatre and company gained wealth. the later plays multiplied to a troupe of eight or nine still not a lot when you consider how many characters the average  play employs. tbtb recently mounted productions of  and a midsummer nights dream using only six actors for each leading schambelan to devise this  and  for a quartet. the measure done this will be a really tough act for future  and  productions to follow.,5,Tragedy,Positive
Romeo & Juliet,Death and Drollness: The New Star-Crossed Lovers,Claudine Nightingale,having seen the lord chamberlains mens performances every year since their conception the company was formed in 2005 as an all male company who aim to replicate the touring companies of s time i was already aware of the unique qualities upon which this company prides itself. sitting with a picnic of delights in front of me on one of this summers rare sunny evenings i was able to gain a few glimpses of preparatory action behind the companys basic yet perfectly sufficient wooden stage which they erect and dismantle themselves at each venue. i managed to steal a wonderfully heart warming view of the cast as just before beginning their performance they embraced in a group to affirm their support for each other and enthusiasm for the performance ahead. it is this very sense of a close knit team that shines through in the performance itself presenting not just individual actors but an interacting group who in turn are able to bring the audience into their inclusive approach to performance. in keeping with renaissance theatrical tradition the players preceded the play with music and song. tlcm executes this with particular effect helping to set the scene in a challenging open air environment by wandering through the picnicking crowd as they sing. with a mixture of madrigals and drinking songs they successfully draw the attention of the audience to the stage. although the mood does as one would expect darken with the dusk as the play progresses an unusually light comedic approach is taken most notably in the opening fight scene.  at first i was taken aback by this approach used to the traditionally sudden violence and conflict that begins most productions of  and . however this approach to the play induces a marvellous portrayal of  richard corgan a character that upon first appearance seems inappropriately comical almost farcical but becomes a brilliant and just interpretation most notable in his own death scene. not only do the puns he utters as he dies have extra emphasis but more empathy for  is possible than in any other performance i have seen.  the audience not only mourns his murder out of sadness for s loss but they feel grief at the loss of the loveable and witty  that they have themselves come to admire. the tragic atmosphere is quickly and cleverly recaptured after the interval aided by the setting of the sun. this performance seems to work perfectly outdoors with darkness naturally descending as the tragedy unfolds. that the serious and melancholic scene between the nurse and  is convincing is evidence that these male actors portrayal of the characters has become entirely accepted by the audience. with this productions more comical interpretation of earlier scenes the audience is almost invited to laugh with the actors as they masquerade as women on stage. this then becomes a liberating theatrical technique which allows the audience having accepted the obvious physical barriers of renaissance acting traditions to concentrate on the words and action of the play. general interpretation and delivery of the text is incredibly effective. not only are the many play on words consciously highlighted but even junior members of the audience seem entranced by the energetically presented dialogue. tlcm seem to have made a clear judgement on  and s relationship one that becomes clear in david eatons portrayal of . an interpretation that initially comes across as mere effeminate male behaviour gradually unearths itself once the play is in its full throes of teenage frivolity. this production seems to  infer that though it may feel genuine to both lovers their frivolity in love the intense and previously unknown power of young love is what causes their unnecessary and untimely end. an original and persuading interpretation and a joy to watch tlcm are doing an invaluable job making s works more accessible to a wider audience whilst living out the spirit and conviviality of the many touring companies of s era.,4,Tragedy,Positive
Romeo & Juliet,A Noble Attempt at Bridging the Great Divide,Denise Battista, and  begins at their end. within the first six lines of the play we learn that our cd stars will die. this stage is set accordingly. a dark wooden stage whose center looks as though its been sprayed with golden paint carries two dark wooden caskets side by side trimmed in gold. the entire cast speaks the chorus opening lines led by the elders and followed by the youth. as the caskets lower and this opening sonnet comes to an end the final statement is that of peace held high on the hand of one of the young actors. director bill rauch aka osfs incoming artistic director 2008 definitely makes some statements in this production. scenic designer christopher acebos set claims a sort of modern simplicity i rather see layers of discussion. s balcony resides up center and sits atop a wall of bars with barred doors left and right leading one to believe that like den this veronas a prison. the most imposing piece on this stage is a large golden cross just off center stage right reaching to s heavens and barring the right side of s balcony. except for the offset of this imposing cross right stage mirrors left. this design certainly highlights rauchs vision of sameness in the play while offsetting the imposed differences that result in tragedy. rauch focuses on the theme of old versus new placing two different time periods on the stage at the same time. the older generation is rooted in the italian renaissance while the younger is planted in 2007 wearing private school lac and soccer uniforms for much of the play. this theme of old versus new follows the recurrence of antithesis in this play   antitheses with a pointed emphasis on love versus hate light versus darkness limitations versus boundlessness and the quick and slow passage of time to name a few. rauch and costume designer shigeru yaji highlights the lack of communication and the generational gap in this play through costume. it revealed new things in the play to me to focus on the generation gap. how do we pass on hatred? we are not born with feuds. feuds are learned behavior whether they are in renaissance italy in urban american neighborhoods in the middle east wherever. we learn to hate each other. how do we pass on hatred to future generations? thinking about a production that might span from a renaissance setting to a contemporary setting really got my brain going. a lot of the drama in the play is that the  and  families are perfectly matched. theres no reason why these two kids  and  shouldnt be together. they seem like they should be a perfect fit except for this feud. this production will be about the sameness of the families.  rauch in terms of fashion or trend the generation gap is so clear in almost every time period. the children dismiss whatever the parents are wearing. they dont care. theyre not interested but they coexist they dont necessarily communicate they coexist. in this production we are just extending that gap. yaji i find it difficult to grasp what yaji is trying to enforce as the youth are in uniform. other than  and  who break from their uniforms and wear more contemporary street clothes for much of the play and except for  who has a rebellious leather clad tattoo ed style of his own they wear school and sport uniforms throughout the play granted with their own flair here and there. these uniforms are imposed by an adult society. the only instance in which rauch and yajis vision makes sense is during the masquerade when  and his boys show up wearing what seems to be italian renaissance garb until they put on their superhero masks with  donning the apropos batman hood. perhaps better would be to follow s renegade fashion but this would not serve to emphasize rauchs vision of sameness. sure the  clan are lac players while the  mob favors soccer but they both play sports they both wear similar uniforms. they all go in and out of the same barred doors when the school bell rings wearing the same crested navy jackets. their families are both alike in dignity though jonathan haugen as lord  seems to be vying for his glory days with a hot and fiery temper and a goblet of drink happily in hand. what i do not question in this play is the acting. christine albright as  is bright and beautiful. she distances herself from talk of marriage by sitting across the stage from her mother shona tucker giggling between appropriate responses just as a girl of not yet fourteen should.  tufts as  is impulsive emotional and extreme lamenting to the sky for understanding. i didnt fall in love with his  which can certainly happen in such a romantic tragedy. heck im still pining away for last seasons cyrano and ive never met marco barricelli in my life. i did however fall in love with albright and tufts. the two onstage together are appropriately one hand one heart. when tufts sees his  rise in the east he stops addressing the sky and turns to his audience  perhaps the only adults who understand him in this play and explains to us her relationship to the heavens. he even kneels before a patron to try and make him grasp the delicacy of touching fair s cheek. one of most lovely parts of a relationship is getting to the point of enjoying those uncomfortable silences. tufts and albright achieve this upon their second meeting as albright lingers on her starlit balcony leaning her head against that imposing cross and tufts sighs down below as they both revel in an uncommonly long yet perfectly timed silence over s inability to remember why she called her  back again. the generation gap is perfectly demonstrated in a scene that in a whirlwind delivers two scenes at the same time. after  and s rené millán untimely demise s nurse played with comedic vigor by demetra pittman informs her lady of s bloody hand followed by  who informs friar   murphey of his wrong doing. at first the two sets of actors take turns making the two scenes apparent but as neither nurse nor friar understand their young friends the four begin to circle the stage until eventually it seems as though  and  are pleading with and standing against the adults who are yet again letting them down. words run into one another and in the end the most important fact chimes out of tufts and albrights mouths simultaneously. that  is banishèd unfortunately their death scene is somewhat lacking. there seems to be just too much going on to focus on the beauty and simplicity of their tragic love. between the set the secret service the generation gap and this sudden feeling that time is not of the essence this final scene lacks passion and emotion no matter how delicately our lovers hands are intertwined. i am a bit confused by rafael untalans portrayal of  in a white leisure suit seems more 1970s than either italian renaissance or 2007 to me and im not a fan of the spandex clad jogger who bounces across the stage from time to time forcing s juan rivera lebron eyes to pop out of his head. i can make some sense of an ill suited . it does highlight the idea that s parents havent a clue as to whom their daughter is best suited to marry. but i cant understand why the 16th century clad prince  josiah phillips has an entourage of secret service men in black suits and shades. what does fit by all measures is dan donohue as . batman in his earliest forms mind you is an isolated vigilante who seeks justice.  is all this with a sort of dark comedic twist. donohues delivery is deliciously tongue in cheek. he taunts the orchard wall climbing  via spotlight in the audience and his queen mab monologue is surprisingly silly throughout although there is a vibratile edge at its end that tells us all that not any adult any peer and perhaps not even we get him. as his fellows kick round a soccer ball wearing their purple and yellow polo shirts donohue looks more like a jet remember riff? in his black leather jacket and jeans. and his death follows his life witty bitter and misunderstood. but the final statement of the play is that of peace.  and  bury their strife with their children. they walk toward one another in an effort to close the ancient gap once and for all. following their childrens lead the two households sign their own form of peace with a handshake. and with this rauchs vision comes full circle. perhaps a bit blurry along the way this production is both insightful and innovative and open in many ways for interpretation.,4,Tragedy,Positive
Romeo & Juliet,Lovefools Immortalized in Central Park,Matthew Barbot,a few minutes before the show began i noticed a detail on stage that made me laugh. parked before what will come to represent a verona storefront are two fruit carts one filled with apples the other with oranges together they underscore one of the plays central themes reminding us of that familiar and very pertinent idiom about irreconcilable differences. like the performance to come this set piece is clever and different. throughout the production which overshoots the chorus stated two hours passage by a whole hour the stage remains very expressive though the aforementioned fruit prove to be not only the subtlest bit but also the most relevant to the action of the play. breaking from a long tradition of producing  with minimal set dressing the public theaters  and  is played on and in a huge wooden circle. within the circle is a shallow pool of water and hanging over that pool is a massive rotating shape shifting wrought iron archwaystaircase. the immense transformable set piece allows for an incredible variety of stage setups that never fail to come off beautifully. so beautifully in fact that it at times threatens to overshadow the actual play and one wonders why it was necessary.  while a pool of water in  and  may bring the cardigans immortal earworm lovefool to  enthusiasts minds in this production it somehow works. if the director michael grief was trying to say something with the casual use of water onstage it doesnt come across. it does however look amazing and always manages to somehow feel right no matter the scene whether in the love scenes or the chaotic fight scenes which are the first fights ive seen in a production of this play that truly capture the sense of the messy street brawls prince  always seems to be complaining about. the water is used effectively and creatively creating an ethereal engaging aesthetic. it is no doubt daunting to live up to such a set but the cast is equally impressive. actors comfortable enough with s language to really act with it as if it was as effortless for them as the words of any contemporary playwrights are a rare commodity but the publics production is chock full of them. the celebrity cast members camryn manheim and lauren ambrose play their roles extremely well. ambroses  is filled with all the naïveté and childish enthusiasm one would expect from a girl not yet fourteen. ambrose is unafraid of making  a realistic adolescent with all the highs and lows that entails rather than a picture of virtue and it works beautifully. playing alongside her manheims nurse is mother and best friend all at once traveling beautifully from one extreme to another without any contradictions first tender and motherly then bawdy loud and hilarious first high spirited and care free now in over her head. oscar isaacs  is at his best when filled with urgency be it from fear excitement love or some combination of them all. the scenes between he and ambrose are always charming. christopher evan welch picks up isaacs slack in many of the less intense scenes as s cynical jester of a friend . in fact he not only captures s mercurial nature but shows his true talent when hes able to transition to a heart wrenching death scene as well. austin pendletons numerous line flubs often seemed to serve his portrayal of friar laurence as a man constantly at his wits end trying to hold all the pieces together as the world falls apart around him. its a credit to the director that this production manages to be fresh and engaging despite being perhaps s most well known play and it shows that the publics  in the park is strongly meeting its goals of bringing s works to a wide audience. the tickets are difficult to come by theyre free but theyre highly sought after but the trouble is worth it. though not without its flaws this production of  and  is a treat for everyone from the most stuffy scholar to those whove never before seen a  performed.,4,Tragedy,Positive
Romeo & Juliet,Berkeley Opera's Romeo and Juliet: Voice Without Poise,Denise Battista,walking into the once church now julia morgan center for the arts flooded my senses on this warm spring evening. i was filled with the strong scent of wood everywhere high beamed ceilings that peak in the center of this 320 seat house shutters painted with doves both left and right and a sense of something quaint yet grand in the midst of this flowery tree lined street.  taking on gounods french roméo et te is ambitious. a new english lyric adaptation dangerous. it could have worked. this production brags elegant and colorful period costuming with cuffed boots and gloves tight tights embroidered jackets frighteningly intimidating codpieces for the men no doubt and beautiful velvet jacquard and silken courtly gowns with cinched waists blouson sleeves and necklines that permit a woman to look well womanly. i was a bit nervous about the set. the few arches within verona look stable enough but a wooden staircase leading up to s boudoir and the balcony itself seem to need some retrofitting. it would be a shame for the one steady star on this stage to fall.  thankfully she didnt. elena krell shines balancing coloratura vocals with an ability to act to project and to endear. no wonder  falls in love. krell is playful as a young girl of not yet fourteen ought to be. stage director  mcmullen does well by having his star crossd lovers act their adolescent impetuous impulsive selves. krell trills a lovely adaptation of je veux vivre while dancing around her rickety room getting her hair tangled in the trellised flowers and looking to the east with wide and happy eyes. the libretto i want to fall. im not afraid to fly left me on the edge of my seat for the sake of potential leaning misjudgments as well as krells ability to transpose her enthusiasm into her audience. im not sure my ears drank a hundred words of s utterings. yet when jimmy kansau sings he becomes the perfect match krell. kansaus acting leaves much to be desired however with leaning toward grotesque facial movements with every thought turn and whim. kansaus strong venezuelan accent devours the language leaving me with a lovehate relationship with  depending on whether he was singing or speaking. you might wonder why this would really matter in an opera. fact is mcmullen and jonathan khuner who created this dramatic arrangement made it matter. this production is half opera half play. some lines remain true to the text. some skip around a bit and some come from i know not where. thankfully there are loosely used supertitles above to help translate kansaus english and they come in handy when the jovial yet out of breath  igor vieira speaks in yet another difficult to understand brazilian accent trying in vain to keep up with the libretto. thankfully this catch me if you can syndrome rectifies itself just in time for vieiras well played and tragic death scene in act 3. between kansau and vieira however listening becomes work punctuated by intermittent enjoyable singing.  j. scott browning  has undeniable theatrical presence onstage but he too gets lost in the music. not because he cant keep up but because his tenor voice is a tad too soft to battle the behind the stage orchestra. browning and others do engage in some exciting swordplay but even a well used sword cant give browning the sinister edge and sharp projection he needs to strike his audience where it counts.  a bit of bawd is inserted into the production in tune with  rather than gounods interpretation. and why not with those codpieces leading every mans way? lowbrow  well played by wayne wong takes the place of gounods charming stephano while vieira seizes every opportunity to acknowledge the sexual puns wonderfully inherent to .  lord of revels and master of the  household  minagro plays a festive father to the fair . minagro unfortunately lacks the dramatic vigor that would set him apart from just being a part that is played.  i could go on and on about the ups and downs of this performance such as the entertaining well played her cups runneth over nurse leslie hassberg the awkward apothecary richard a. goodman who i assume walked in off the street to play the part the dashing  anders froehlich who i almost wish would have won the heart of  and the abounding stature of richard mix who reminded more of a magical prospero than a prince of verona. and who could forget the pyramus and thisbe like wall our  and  wes layton awkwardly carry and plant halfway up s stairs for the sake of a moving duet between our lovers only to be awkwardly removed once the duo part in sweet sorrow? tis an unnecessary accoutrement that mirrors midsummers mechanicals more so than anything befitting of this opera.  as i walked out of the opera house and onto the street lined with sweet smelling flowers my senses were once again overwhelmed.  of course i was touched by gounods tragical ending that allows our lovers to realize their dire mistake before taking their last breath together.  their beautiful voices carried me down the street in a dream.  but from a dream one must awaken and remember that wicked wall.,3,Tragedy,Negative
Othello,Humor and Absurdity in a Tragedy,Yuko Kurahashi,the s globe production of  directed by claire van kampen featuring andré holland as  and  rylance as iago is an invigorating work filled with humor pathos and tragi comedic absurdity. this emphasis on comedic moments has a historical resonance  one of the most popular plays in early seventeenth century england was staged as part of court entertainments and celebrations including the wedding of the daughter of james i in the winter of 1612 and the court performance for king  i in 1635. the uniqueness of this production owes much to the portrayal of iago and  the conspirators against  and . in black pants boots and shiny pleated shirt donnelly portrays  as a wily opportunist who is manipulated by the clever iago. donnelly and rylance are a perfect duo whose frivolous relationship eventually destroys other characters who fail to catch their lies and deceits. the energy of this production comes from the dynamic ensemble of both veterans and younger actors  rylance  chubb  badria timini lodovica instead of  andré holland jessica warbeck  sheila atim  steffan donnelly  aaron pierre  catherine bailey  micha loubon chorus ira mandela siobhan chorus and clemmie sveaas chorus. the musicians led by music director bill barclay emma arden beth higham edwards darren moore adrian woodward support the show playing percussive rhythmical and sometimes melancholic music. rylances mumblings and repetition of words dominate the stage. he portrays iago not as an ordinary guy but with humor and charm. wearing a red cap while the other soldiers wear berets and pants too short for him rylances mustached iago looks like super mario. his iago entertains himself by lying and inventing an honest persona while his role play is so obvious and outrageous that every time hes called honest iago the audience bursts into laughter. van kampen utilizes rylances iconoclasm in her stage direction. for example in act ii sc. 3 iago leads a merriment for the soldiers and their women by singing dancing and playing the lute. this scene attests to the two sides of iago a jester but one who  finds pleasure in manipulating others. rylances iago excels in presenting himself as an honest man. in act iii sc.3 hollands  rebukes iagos claim of s infidelity. rylance starts to take off his uniform preparing for his pretended exit where he turns to recite the famous lines o grace o heaven forgive meare you a man? have you a soul? or sense?god buy you take mine office and finishing with i thank you for this profit and from henceill love no friend since love breeds such offence. rylances iago as s loyal subject is so convincing that the audience just accepts this facade as genuine. hollands  and jessica warbecks  wearing matching costumes with exquisite embroideries demonstrate compatibility and harmony until s suspicion and jealousy start to grow. their loving relationship shown in the first part of the play tragically deteriorates in the latter half. during this period warbeck portrays  as kind and gentle yet with honor integrity and strength. this makes her fate all the more tragic. the gem of this production is atim as  s lady in waiting. atim underscores the characters sharpness and outspokenness she is contemptuous of her husband iago. elegantly dressed in a champagne colored long silk dress she contrasts  iagos lack of fashion sense. though relatively simple van kampens production designed by jonathan fensom has its own spectacles. the red flag for the court of venice in act i is lowered and rolled up transforming into a ships mast in the storm scene.  and  arrive in cyprus on ships carts from side doors of the groundling pushed by the attendants. this tragedy ends with a song and dance number. after the arrest of iago followed by s suicide and lodovicas command to  and   as a spirit appears and sings a song. the bed is pushed upstage providing space for clemmie sveaas and ira mandela siobhan to dance. wearing white costumes like  and s costumes in the final scene the two performers choreographed by antonia franceschi convey how  and s love is restored up in heaven. then all of the characters including  and  enter and sing as if paying homage to the dead characters reminiscent of the last scene of sweeney todd. the s globes signature curtain call with an upbeat song and dance number concludes the show bringing this tragedy to an end and celebrating another successful theatrical event together with the audience. this production concludes the s globes springsummer season. their winter season at the sam wannamaker playhouse the globes indoor theatre consists of tragedies and history plays by  and marlowe and works by contemporary playwrights.,5,Tragedy,Positive
All's Well That Ends Well,Confounding “The Iago Epilogue” Initiates Rather than Ends the Conversation,Robert M. LoAlbo,the old fable of the scorpion and the frog goes something like this a scorpion needs to cross the river but unable to do so asks a lowly frog for a lift. hesitant to carry him on his exposed back the frog makes the scorpion promise that he will under any circumstances sting the frog. halfway across the river the scorpion sinks his tail deep into the frogs back dooming the both of them to a watery grave. when the frog asks the scorpion why he did it the scorpion responds i couldnt help myself. its my nature. iago is possibly the most evil of all of s characters for his motivation to ensnare the virtuous  seems so slight and the hate filled revenge exacted upon the moor seems severely ill proportionate to the crime of essentially being passed over for promotion. in fact iago is so filled with poison that he doesnt just get revenge he destroys a human being. many of us have found ourselves in similar positions when the ill equipped underling getting undue recognition while our hard work clearly demands the position but few if any of us have been filled with homicidal tendencies to the point of action. its this audience imposed logic that makes iago and his nature such a mystery to us. having someone succumb to the somewhat vainglorious efforts to explain and justify iagos actions isnt so farfetched a scenario as writerproducerstar  grant suttie most likely succumbed to that fanciful desire years ago when she wrote the iago epilogue. although an attempt at explanation and demystification of a purely evil character can sometime end up feeling more like a hollow attempt at exploring hannibal lecters backstory or throwing darth vader a pity party with needless exposition this film thankfully doesnt give us easy or for that matter lucid answers. its this films abashed philosophical utterances and abrupt vagaries that keep us guessing as to iagos true motivation an answer that intentionally eludes us even more so having viewed the film. the films foundational premise is that iago has been imprisoned in solitary confinement for the last nine years and is only now breaking silence choosing to break the fourth wall for our sake. set in modern time the film begins with doctored news footage regarding iagos crimes and sentencing but the subpar overdubbing and scattershot editing meant to evoke an of the moment feel ends up feeling more like a high school english project. my kingdom for a sound mixer its an immediate wrong note but thankfully its more window dressing than actual panorama successfully hinting at additional upcoming risks the filmmakers are willing to take. when we next delve into iagos cell where the majority of the film occurs dp and director steven lamorte lovingly bathes grant suttie in shadows and gorgeously rendered hues of browns and grays no doubt meant to evoke david finchers serial killer grittiness. fittingly seductive musical choices suggest calculated manipulation via iagos self justified reasons to the audience. all this atmosphere complemented with grant sutties hollow stares and sullen eye sockets and the audience feels the years of silent contemplation weighing on her as she is the ouroboros the snake that eats its own tail forever. grant sutties close study of the text and character is apparent as her deft understanding of the play reveals itself in clever characterization and acute mannerisms. yet the choice to cast herself in the main role suggests an attempted statement regarding modern gender roles via this swapping stunt but shes two hours late to the party. the audience is already so accustomed to this parlor trick that weve become somewhat numb to it. but not to worry as grant sutties script and lamortes direction have a few more tricks and subtexts up their sleeves. drawing deeply from the well or toilet bowl? of manipulation as crime the screenwriter star drinks deep from the fact that iagos only crime is insinuation and slander. you see iago did nothing wrong and blames everyone but herself its gods countenance s jealousy mankinds sinful nature she was born this way whatever. shes written so teflon ish that she delusionally refers to herself as honest iago. the first time she shortly thereafter breaks into a coughing fit revealing the humanity of a character sometimes dismissed as a monster. and maybe thats one of grant suttie main points that she wants us to see iago for who heshe is and not just brush himher off as we have so many of historys most horrible human beings. our vilification of historys greatest monsters brings about a disservice to us both as we can thus rank them as not us thereby relieving us of the possible responsibility of becoming like them. but when iago can barely speak from between gasps of air we see that shes just as human as we are and that we have the capability of being just as manipulative and calculating as she is. the second time she gives herself this misguided nomenclature is right before she repeatedly bashes her head upon a toilet claiming to us am i not what i am? its this scripted delusional conclusion that propels so much of the film that iago is nothing more than the scorpion on the frogs back. and as iago slowly kicks her own ass throughout the brief runtime we cant help but wonder if she is her own worst enemy. maybe all that befalls her throughout s play could have been avoided if she just like the rest of us kept her head down and worked her way slowly towards a comfortable life in middle management. and just when we think weve got the character figured out grant sutties script throws a few more curveballs our way when she literally fights a losing battle and its now iagos hubris that drives the character to make such malicious jumps in logic thinking she can convince us and herself of her pure motives. its the scripts constant confounding of the character that pulls us into the film a paradoxical paradigm of a villain that forces us to examine our own humanity. maybe this isnt the iago we necessarily want but the one we need right now in order to understand our lives what with her single minded dictatorial misguided patriotism fighting in support of a racial divide. and with grant suttie deliciously chewing the scenery like the bastard daughter of charlie manson it may all be a bit much at times but at least watching her smash her own head in is cathartic. despite uneven production values and a lack of restraint where some could aid its grant sutties hurly burly of a script that shines brightest in this murkiest of swamps even if it all ends up being an exercise in pseudo psychology and comes to nothing more than a host of even more questions than when we started. yet by getting through this wild ride of a short we now know what we dont know which is why we keep allowing that damn scorpion onto our backs thinking that maybe this will be the time he wont sting us. the iago epilogue is currently traveling the festival circuit and will be shown at la femme film festival in los angeles ca on october 19 2017. the film can also be seen at httpbattlegroundproductions.orgprojectsthe iago epilogue.,3,Comedy,Negative
Othello,A Morally Ambiguous Othello,Jennifer Kramer,for many the main thrust of  is the conflict between the noble moor of venice and the dastardly motiveless villain iago with the latter twisting societal prejudice and personal jealousy alike into weapons to enact his revenge. in the  theatre companys production of  however director dan hodge approaches the play from a slightly different point of view. in his directors note hodge res in returning to this play i am struck by how often liars tell the truth and truthful characters lie. we are presented with a morally ambiguous world and i am thoroughly interested in relationships founded in true love and respect turning sour. the result is a production that focuses as much on the ensemble as  and iago themselves and examines the degree to which everyone involved is complicit in the tragedy. this interpretation is anchored by steven a. wright as . in an example of the ambiguity hodge pursues s assertion that he is rude in speech and little blessed with the soft phrase of peace seems completely inaccurate. wright imbues all of s dialogue with rhetorical passion and a suggestion of the theatrical but leaves it up to the audience to decide whether his assessment is the result of deliberate self deprecation or of internalizing the biased judgments of others. wrights  begins the play a respected military man filled with familiar affection for the men under his command and passionately in love with his new wife. when s new father in law insults his character and hurls racial epithets wright exudes a soldierly stoicism the merest traces of pain and anguish on his face when  breaks up  and s brawl in the streets his displeasure is considerably more vocal the righteous rage of a disappointed commander whose orders have been disobeyed. by the time iago informs  of his suspicions of s loyalty wright displays an anger already escaping s self control to the extent that he almost shoots or rather chokes the messenger. wright associates s descent into tragedy with the increasing damage to his psyche as his most significant personal connections are inexorably damaged. the rest of the cast reinforces the importance of these personal connections through their nuanced presentation of their characters as dynamic individuals. eric scotolatis performance as  quickly establishes both the friendly charm that endears him to  and  as well as the flaws which iago exploits a susceptibility to peer pressure and its fall out. scotolati does not shy away from making  a mean drunk giving him an anger and possessiveness that foreshadow s own. the flaws of  isa st. clair meanwhile are not so much of personality as of circumstance. st. clair portrays her as sweet and inexperienced but with a firm resolve  evolves from initial hesitance to speak up in front of the senators and her father to an ant defense of . but st. clair also shows the downside of this disposition as her  is incapable of comprehending the cause or depths of s jealousy while possessing the grim determination to set things right even at risk to her personal safety. this raises several alarm bells for the more worldly  rachel gluck whose growing friendship with  almost in spite of her cynicism is a sweet note amidst the plays angst. gluck gradually reveals that beneath s cool exterior lurks a longing for greater intimacy despite her critical attitude towards iago gluck plays  as reluctantly invested in her marriage. she tries to garner his favor by flirtatiously presenting the stolen handkerchief to him in her garter and despite her general disenchantment she fails to suspect iagos involvement in her mistress downfall. interestingly gluck and wright have a few interactions that seem to suggest iago had cause for his suspicions of  cuckolding him with  but only a few keeping the extent of their involvement a mystery. similarly iagos physical affection for the very people whose lives hes destroying would seem to be a pretense but this is complicated by moments where hes alone on stage. several times after setting into motion the next stage of his treachery iago collapses against the nearest support in exhaustion during the plays denouement after being attacked by  he lies nearly motionless on the ground as his plan is fulfilled by s suicide. mccann leaves it to the audience to determine which if any of iagos affections were genuine or if he ultimately found any satisfaction in his revenge. aetna gallaghers costume design adds another metatextually amusing layer to the tangled web of iagos motivations the combination of a dark jerkin and ruffled shirt collar with mccanns haircut and facial hair gives iago a distinct resemblance to the bard himself suggesting that  has been ambushed from behind the fourth wall by the literal author of his destruction. the rest of the costumes content themselves with quietly evoking the rich color schemes of italian renaissance paintings in fashions from the same period the men wear doublets and jerkins in gold trimmed browns blacks olives and reds with the ladies echoing them in lovely gowns. if there is any misstep it is the costuming for  who appears to be something of a time traveler in her medieval kirtle and surcoat with modern stockings and garters. the exception to this palette is  who stands out in a complimentary but visually striking ivory gown with teal bodice and slashes on her sleeves the effect highlights her status as a relative newcomer to the group as well as its most innocent member. the set design by paul kuhn is an even more subtle rendition of the renaissance aesthetic the simple thrust stage and the pillars at its corners have the appearance of sepia and black marble. but the restrained design is not without its clever details the red velvet curtains upstage are torn away by iago after his soliloquy at the close of act i revealing a set of wooden stairs disappearing into darkness. combined with the excellent chiaroscuro lighting by tim martin this setup allows for a visual reflection of the shadowy motives at work within the play and the overall design is an excellent choice for the intimate space within the theater. these thoughtful elements are characteristic of hodges approach to the production. the text is streamlined but not simplified and hodge combines minor characters usually giving their lines to  or  to provide a greater sense of continuity. the fight scenes are quick brutal and eschew the flourishes of some kinds of stage fighting though they occasionally suffer from some obvious pulled punches. with the excellent work by the cast the ambiguity hodge cultivates increases the tension as the characters inner darknesses are presented with beautiful clarity. the result is a steadily paced production that perfectly synthesizes text acting and stagecraft culminating in the plays final scene.  lies sleeping on the darkened stage while  emerges from the shadows and descends the stairs holding a candle. their final confrontation and s murder still all too visible to the audience take place lit by that single source.  extinguishes it with his utterance of i have no wife an echo of his earlier deliberation about putting out s light. the ambiguities of thought and motive of racism jealousy and hatred come to an end with this irrevocable act for the rest of the scene the stage is flooded with light as the truth is revealed. the strength of the s production of  is its acknowledgement that like the tragedies of our own times the origins are many and the consequences will continue to be felt by all.,4,Tragedy,Positive
Othello,An Appetizing Othello,Melissa Crismon,director barry edelstein from new yorks  in the park makes his debut at the old globe choosing  since it hasnt been seen on this stage in a while. he felt that eight of the characters have   tremendously juicy roles and intuition told him these roles would   create opportunities for really interesting actors to come and do really interesting work. and the play does draw interesting actors. percussive music ushers in iago richard thomas with the cast hitting sticks together and pounding rods on the floor. with thomass grand entrance he makes his presence known and never lets you forget he is a lovely scoundrel. he arrogantly lights a small cigar then throws the match in the air. despicable he has everyone do his dirty work like the devil.  played by jonny orsini is first to fall victim as thomas goads him to tell  mike sears of his daughters marriage to . thomas hides in the dark while using guttural language to get  riled up and the audience laughing. one entertaining moment happens during a party. while the men drink and dance with their women the world freezes. thomas continues the music with sounds of the beat strutting on stage. while he dances he pours more wine in the cup of  noah bean in hopes to cause a fight between him and . at the end of the freeze he thrusts his hips with a pow the music and dancing continue. he repeats this a few times becoming more obnoxious. thomas lies to the face of  blair underwood who is a good and honest man assuming thomass iago is the same. underwoods accent finds itself in the caribbean which is a bit odd for a moor but close enough. he says  in an appetizing thunderous gravelly voice. underwoods  is all consuming in his love for  played by kristen connolly as he repeatedly kisses her lips with no awareness to all around. this true love is ripped apart by thomass manipulative opinions that underwood insists on hearing. when underwoods  is distraught he has a seizure that is captivating as he scatters his words and moves his hands while gazing wide eyed into middle space showing the world whirling around him. kristen connollys  is sweet and kind and she doesnt suspect s change of heart. underwoods  begins to strangle her in public. she falls to the floor gasping for air when  played by kushtrim hoxha attempts to aid her but she taps her hand in the air to signal to stay out of this quarrel. its a tragic ending for  and connollys gripping death brings gasps from the audience. the set design by wilson chin consists of walls and desks and other furniture brought on by actors. a few of the scenes utilize two silver walls that roll onto the stage. the walls look like they are covered in tin foil with a well done finish. part of the set design includes the live music. jonathan hepfer and ryan nestor music director musicians housed in the veranda typically used for the actors in the past play an array of percussive instruments. curtis moores original music creates a sense of urgency. being able to see the musicians adds excitement to the show. costume designer  roth dresses kristen connolly in unassuming edwardian dresses. one dress is blocked in fuchsia. another is a see through robins egg blue over muslin. the men are dressed in military uniforms with long coats and high collars over black tall boots and vests. in the past the old globes  festival has been three productions in repertory with one of the shows relating or not relating to . this year edelstein withdrew the non  play and separated the two remaining shows as it had been a decade ago. with three large productions sharing the stage the set design had to quickly come down for the next nights rotating show or the three shows would have to compromise. many times reoccurring actors were seen in all three productions. this year there are two separate casts. another noticeable change is the sound system. when airplanes fly over the actors are heard clearly. with all the changes its still the same great performances at the old globes  festival. edelsteins production of  provides tragedy humor music and rich performances.,5,Tragedy,Positive
Othello,Lies to the Heart: The Power of Words in Othello,Jennifer Kramer,in the philadelphia  theaters program notes dramaturg annalisa castaldo notes that in  the power of language plays as crucial a role as that of race. from  allegedly rude in speech but prone to measured speeches to iago unraveling his targets with paradoxical wittery to  unable to even speak the word with which she has been falsely accused   all participate in a story of seduction and betrayal quite apart from anything physical. however in the philadelphia  theaters production the visual provides a fitting supplement to the language without distracting from the plays emphasis on the potency of words. as the title character forrest mcclendon channels an apparent contradiction   the contrast between s bad self report rude am i in my speech and little blessd with the soft phrase of peace and his actual eloquence   into an extremely clever character attribute. he gives  a unique speaking style not so much an accent as a particular cadence distinct from but still complementary to the typical rhythms of s language. its well suited to mcclendons powerful delivery and easily conveys s identity as both an inspiring commander on the field and an inspired storyteller who won a wife with his words. it also distinguishes him aurally while  is eponymously of venice he sounds like no other venetian just as he looks like no other venetian. s appearance is most reed upon in the play but mcclendon makes it clear that a whole host of factors   racial cultural and personal    contribute to setting  apart. his speech his manner his bearing even his madness separate him from the other characters but mcclendons  is alienated from his fellows not from humanity. j hernandez as iago meanwhile takes nearly the opposite tack. his energetic performance   gamboling all over the stage invading personal space snapping off speeches both witty and chilling   ingratiates him with characters and audience both even as he engineers the downfall of those around with an almost inhuman disregard. hernandezs iago has been passed over for promotion but is never not in control until his schemes have completely crumbled around him. appropriately this comes at the hands of the two characters who arent completely taken in by his words. lauren sowas  is lively and feisty cheerfully preventing iago from linguistically gaining the upper hand for perhaps the only time in the play during their banter at the beginning of act 2. sowas performance deftly portrays a woman who though sheltered and privileged nevertheless possesses the passionate and adventurous spirit to elope with  and follow him to war. this spirit attracts the loyalty of  a brilliant performance by eleni delopoulos whose own spirit has clearly been almost extinguished from either her marriage to iago or some other unfortunate circumstance. she flinches from the merest hint of displeasure from an authority figure and reaches out to others to comfort or be comforted only to withdraw   or in the case of her husband to be coldly and viciously shut down. however  is the only one cognizant of iagos cruelty and once he has caused the death of her only friend delopoulos kindles s fading spirits into an inferno of righteousness weaponizing the truth for her courageous last stand in exposing iagos and s murderous deeds. as an inspiration for the production design director carmen khan utilizes the works of caravaggio   citing the painters use of light and shadow   to produce a renaissance italian setting. this setting is reflected most successfully in the costumes by designer vickie esposito beautiful concoctions that echo the 16th and 17th centuries and caravaggios designs in spirit if not always in period accuracy. esposito also uses the characters dress to bring out subtle reminders of their stations and personalities. while   and iago all wear a similar uniform   a military khaki drab with black accents   iagos is simpler and of less expensive fabric while  wears his bracers and other accoutrements of war. the wealthy nobility in the play all appear in flowing robes and gowns but  stands out with the intricate bejeweling and detailing on her dresses sartorial vividness matching personal boldness. by contrast lisi stoessels set design is fairly simple supporting the design aesthetic without overwhelming it. plaster walls and plain arched entries and windows are suggestive enough of the mediterranean to pass for both venice and cyprus while the nested arches within arches of the side exits hint at shadowy doings and hidden motives. in some respects though one wishes the caravaggio references were carried further with more dramatic lighting and vivid colors the production lacks his signature ultra clarity even though it is eminently suited to it. this is most evident at the beginning of the play when the greenish plaster of the backdrop pale blue  and neutral shaded costumes dappled cerulean lighting and pre show rain sound effects all combine to create a soothing atmosphere with relaxed visuals   hardly the best way to convey the lurking tensions waiting to burst into bloody fruition. the sound design proves to be one of the productions weaker elements the discordant jigging march between acts though usly anachronistic still could have contributed to the mood had it not blasted forth at top volume and the smart drum rolls heralding various entrances would have been perfectly unreable had the characters not persisted in referring to them as trumpets. however as the play progresses the nods khan does make to her inspiration roll out with pleasing subtlety as some artful blocking results in scenes with characters positioned as though they had stepped from a renaissance painting without ever sacrificing the actors naturalistic performances. the exception is the very stylized set dressing at the beginning of act 5 where ensemble members carry out s bed in the manner of pallbearers and ceremoniously arrange its canopy a chilling if almost heavy handed foreshadowing of the coming climax. appropriately for a production emphasizing the power of words there are very few emendations made to the text   the notable targets being the tangential clown scenes at the beginning of act 3 and the dying words of  and . the latter besides eliminating the plot hole of how a strangled  even managed to have last words also resonates with the productions greater themes as the violence visited upon these women is so dire as to rob them of their rightful speech. this respect for the power of language along with the strong performances by the cast the healthy support of the production design and khans balancing hand ultimately result in a nearly perfect marriage of words and visuals. the philadelphia  theater makes it clear that the story of  and s words are just as seductive to a modern audience.,5,Tragedy,Positive
All's Well That Ends Well,Orson Welles's Film Noir,J. A. Macfarlane,orson welless 1952  is one of the lesser known of  films partly due to its chequered history. made over several years whenever welles could scrounge up enough money to do some more work on it it suffered from poor sound design the lack of a final cut and inadequate copy distribution that gave only a butchered view of what it might be. fortunately in 1992 michael radford spearheaded a restoration of the film which involved not only clearing up the image but reworking the entire soundtrack recreating audio effects to replace the inadequate original ones and completely rerecording the score to produce not simply a clear version of a massacred film but something as close as possible to what welles would have done had he had the means. the restoration was approved by welless daughter. thanks to these efforts we can finally see  for what it is and what it was meant to be. when orson welles made a movie from a  play he did not simply take a production from the stage and rearrange it for bigger more realistic sets. he radically altered the text for the sake of filmic effect in essence translating plays into movies rather than adapting them just as giuseppe verdi translated the plays into operas. intriguingly both welles and verdi used the same three characters     and falstaff   as the basis for their works. unlike laurence olivier who like welles directed and starred in three  films welles tirelessly asserts the primacy of the visual when making a film and nowhere more clearly than in his film of . there is scarcely so much as a single shot in the film unworthy of attention. watching this film is like attending an art exhibition where every painting on the wall rivals the next for attention with hardly time enough to completely take each one in. it is welles at his most expressionistic the screen a nest of shadows and bars producing an inescapable feeling of enclosure and imprisonment. the world of this  is as much a prison as den is to . the aesthetic is almost that of a horror film but one crafted by the eye of a master. beginning with the funeral processions of  and  the films solemn opening is disrupted as iago is dragged in the opposite direction at the end of a chain hauled through a howling crowd to be locked in a cage that is hoisted into the air there to be left to starve as he watches the funerals. the inescapability of the plot is accentuated by this framing we know from the start there is no chance that the story will turn out differently no hope for a happy ending. the characters are trapped in their story as much as in their surroundings which are framed by high walls and iron grills even in the outdoor scenes there is no escape the ons of venice are overlooked by buildings whose height blocks out the sky cyprus is rounded by a raging ocean that offers no refuge. in this claustrophobic setting the characters go about their ordained lives. welles is excellent as  imposing in size and voice his unmatchable bass rolling out the famous  music with both power and unexpected moments of grace. physically he dominates the screen effortlessly communicating the moors authority   at least until iagos poison begins to work when  is suddenly seen off kilter at skewed angles a small man lost in a massive fortress an effect similar to a famous shot in welless citizen kane. from then on s size becomes menacing as the physical power ideal for a soldier is suddenly seen as being also the brutal threat of the wife beater and murderer. but at the same time there is a deep uncertainty in him hidden behind the image he projects   the crack that iago uses to destroy him. there are moments when welless acting comes across as hammy and overdone   the roast me with sulphur sequence especially comes to mind though it is admittedly difficult to play otherwise   but in the main it is an impressive performance. suzanne cloutier as  suffers from the radical surgery that has been performed on her part. with her role amputated of most of its lines she is reduced to a cipher a white and blonde apparition drifting through the gloom. cloutier is a deeply dignified  but she is not permitted to come to life it is not even that she is objectified but simply that welles seems to have no feeling for the possibilities of the role. she is given only a snippet of the willow song which she hums as she stops  from completing her disquisition against men. yet even so she is deeply affecting in the final scenes particularly as she lies in bed with her eyes open listening to s approach knowing full well what is to come before closing them suddenly when he opens the bed curtains. as iago micheál macliammóir gives an extraordinarily dark performance so dark in fact that it can stand as an example of just how welles has arranged things to realise his gothic interpretation. iago is no doubt a villainous psychopath but shorn of all his humour it is impossible to believe that no one else would realise what he is. even  an exceptionally fatuous robert coote should have been able to see through him. what is truly fascinating about macliammóirs performance however is the sense one gets that he does not fully understand himself any more than does anyone else. when in his final line he tells  what you know you know there is an unexpected realisation that he does not claim to know more himself. imprisoned in his cage his face is blank except for an odd hint of sity   as though he is not entirely certain why all this has happened either. as a film then  is an unmistakeable success. its consistent aesthetic is matched by an extraordinary score well in advance of its time by alberto barberis and angelo francesco lavagnino anchored by a descending series of piano chords and moved forward by a wordless chorus. the opening funeral procession is a reable set piece and iagos murder of  must rank as one of the creepiest moments in all of filmed  as  cowers beneath the planks of a bathhouse and iago in complete silence stabs repeatedly through the slats with his sword searching for his victim.welless vision is powerful enough that the inescapable goofs that mar a film made in stages over three years do not detract from it not even the un synched lips or iagos magically disappearing and reappearing facial hair. it is a stunning piece of art. as an adaptation of  however   well thats a slightly different matter. all productions of  have to make choices often involving cuts to the text and this is even more so with screen adaptations. welless choice to favour his own vision over s text is a valid decision but will make for uncomfortable viewing by purists. while verdi simply cut the first act from his opera welles retains it but rushes through it as fast as he can narrating it as though it were a fairy tale with the more famous scenes acted out in full. perhaps it is only that welles did not have enough time to film it properly but as an example the line put up your bright swords is delivered so quickly and inconsequentially that one is left feeling he simply didnt dare leave it out. as indicated the cuts to s part leave her little more than a cog in the works of both iago and welles at once while iago himself becomes even more of a mystery. complexity is ironed out and the play becomes little more than a gothic melodrama albeit a spectacularly

Othello,"A Dark, Swift Othello in Austin",Michael Meigs,much of s  takes place in cyprus that island in the eastern mediterranean flooded with dazzling sunshine. in contrast philip kreyches production of the play for his noaz productions is staged mostly in shadows in the under lit center stage on real street in austin texas. the contrast between my memories of the island and the imaginary space inhabited by kreyches company was intense but appropriate.  is after all about devilish work double dealing in the dark culminating in a nighttime stabbing and assassination followed by the moorish generals regretful murder in their marriage bed of  the woman whom he loves beyond reason. philip kreyche produces the piece directs it and appears as . intelligent and ambitious in the past two years he has written pieces of reable depth dealing with the expressionist painter oscar kokoschka with persian epic myth and with the quasi mythical queen boudikka also boadicea or boudica who fought roman legions. he appeared with austin  as  in man and superman and as  in  and this past spring he produced directed and took the title role in . for this staging of  kreyche has assembled a strong cast that complements his talent and appearance. its a gripping at times searing evening one that builds relentlessly through treachery to the tragic ending. kreyche is comfortably assertive frank and well spoken as the north african general of the title role.  despite the title of the tragedy its s subaltern iago who drives the action with double dealing and duplicity that he shares frankly with the audience. in that role timothy verret delivers a performance that is cynical powerful and riveting. verret uses emphatic mannered gesture throughout a physical style that one might associate more readily with the likes of will kempe the famous clown at the globe. kempe never had the opportunity of course for he had separated from the company some years earlier and died in 1603 the year that  was probably first staged. often the attraction of the clown is his complicity with the audience    a wink a grimace an acknowledgement that he and we know more than the others on the stage. verrets iago is deadpan most of the time but that candor and his physicality draw us to him even as we resist his intentions. surely theres nothing more alarming than an evil clown one whos resolutely without a smile. though verret is not a small man in the presence of kreyche as  he appears to contract in height somewhat like a turtle retreating into a shell. christina leidel is playing opposite kreyche for a second time. her lady  was turned inward in contrast her frank and adoring  is immensely attractive and cleanly transparent. s confusion is evident as iago poisons s mind against her. the scene in iv 2 in which she confides her chagrin to iagos wife  played by grace marlow is deeply touching.  braids her mistresss hair and speaks of preparing her bed as if both women have a foreshadowing of the murder to come.these four have a beautiful mastery of the language and the verse. they are ably supported by a reduced but capable cast including especially rob novak as the unfortunate michael  cashiered by  and supplicant to .there is a smooth inevitable build to the final scene in the bedroom. in that small theatrical space the pallet is laid out almost within reach of the first row. the scene plays with a breathtaking intimacy of emotion from kreyches entrance with the grieving monologue it is the cause it is the cause my soul through accusations pleading the strangling of  and s discovery of the murder.there is no lag in the staging which is done with a single intermission. costuming is appropriate for a bare bones staging except for the fact that the thin fabric of the tights on male actors made underwear unfortunately visible. lighting is often inadequate and a key reach on stage left of this black box theatre remained entirely dark.this  is a swift and moving evening and kreyches performance outdoes his previous appearances all laudable for depth and eloquence.  timothy j. verrets iago is equally striking and memorable.  and iago live vividly in these dark scenes and define for us the opposed far reaches of moral dealing.,4,Tragedy,Positive
Othello,Swivel Makes Confident Debut with Othello,Christopher Adams,there is a moment in swivel theatre companys robust and impressive debut production of  when emelia jennifer shakesby delivers a speech on male female relationships but i do think it is their husbands faults if wives do fall . the moment bubbles with the possibilities of back story we feel that an entire second play has gone on before and it is a testament to s writing and shakesbys talent that we witness un told fights jealousies hatreds and gameplays compressed into some dozen and a half lines. diyan zora in her directorial debut sets a steady course for s tragedy and utilizes atmosphere and a strong cast to chilling effect. in a  program note swivel states the company seeks to balance creative license with traditional interpretation. zora finds this balance in paying close attention to the text and situating the play in a modern military state. the concept is aided by the theatre itself. barons court theatre is a cavernous space under the curtains up pub. an energy of hard surfaces runs through the production as characters smack the solid walls and slap the floor. fight sequences choreographed by dominic leeder who plays  are given a brutal quality from the cold tile concrete blocks and studded wood paneling. the theatres low damp ceilings lend a claustrophobic sense to the production enhanced by jane cahills muted lighting design. more creative use could be made of the stage since many scenes are played against the back wall but as a space the barons court theatre is snugly fitted for this . swivel employed an open casting policy resulting in a solid cast. tom favas iago makes clear his motivations for plotting against  el razzougui. he quickly switches from insinuating advisor to fast thinking plotter in his well delivered soliloquies. leeders blokey  and tom stanleys  create a believable atmosphere of soldiery. the true revelation is that of rowena lennons duke often a side part but lennon turns her into a business minded manager in business skirt and high heels. the early discussions of war and troop movements are handled with a firm officiousness. in giving  his charge lennon has a delightful touch of m commissioning bond. yet she also captures the dramas horror when at the end she witnesses her controlled world fall apart under the influence of misguided human passions. razzouguis  commands respect and comes across a natural leader. in his initial love for  devon lang wilton he is all lover winking to iago as he says good night and heads to bed. but his transformation is impressive if perhaps a bit too quick the pacing of the jealous making scene could use some tweaking. wilton as  is free and happy go lucky and shocked beyond the point of action after being accused of adultery. even as she is being strangled she tries to kiss . the company keeps the pace cracking a good thing as the 8 pm start means the show does not finish until nearly 11. but the production finds a sweet spot among competing claims pace attention to the verse sustainable drama and emotional connection. as a debut production swivels  is a confident show. it provides not only a solidly acted and gripping evening but it also promotes textual nuance allowing unspoken backstories to appear.,3,Tragedy,Negative
Othello,The Ills We Do: Race and Gender in ASP's Othello,Deirdre Yee,  has always fascinated audiences because it entices us with an intimate glimpse into deep psychological torment. the transformation of the titular character terrifies and jason bowens portrayal of  is chilling. performed in the villa victoria center for the arts actors  projects production of  is a tour de force of betrayal and anguish. at times the dialogue falters but the forceful performances of   and  engage the audience throughout. jason bowen is captivating as  and his transformation is apparent. his initial excess of joy and good fortune exudes jolliness but the trembling violent and unstable man he becomes is almost unrecognizable from his confident and love struck beginning. bowens  is all in all in spleen swayed from jubilance to physical illness by iagos grating hints of treachery. despite his crises of jealousy the key to bowens fabulous performance is in his eyes where the audience can see madness brewing. brooke hardmans enduring love as  is beautiful and terrible to watch and her quiet grief is palpable. overcome with her own nervous energy it chills the audience as she prepares her deathbed with her wedding sheets singing a sweet and mournful song that we know is really a lament. the scene is enchanting and the poignant sisterly love between  and  is heartbreaking. paula langtons performance as  is the most gut wrenching and identifiable on the stage. a modern audience who cannot identify with jealousy triggered epileptic fits and who rightly sees a love outlasting violence as domestic abuse will recognize themselves in s cynicism and weary unrequited love. she is a breath of fresh air in extremes of love and hate sex and murder. and for all her bitterness she is completely caught off guard by the plot that claims everything she cares about including what little opinion she has of her husband. langton captivates. though the victims of iagos plots give tender and affecting performances ken cheesemans portrayal of iago leaves much to be desired. cheesemans iago is lanky and ridiculous with exaggerated gesticulations and he practically winks at the audience during every scene of deception. this tone better fits a fool witty and cunning yet ridiculous. iagos brazen lies serve as comic relief but cheeseman leaves the audience yearning for a villain. the whole play is saturated with dramatic irony and the audience is privy to all of iagos conniving tricks. this tension does not need to be emphasized by cheeseman treating every lie like an aside. repetition in the script already fulfills this role including dozens of proclamations of honest iago. the exchanges would be more chilling and authentic if we like the decent people turned to puppets by his devices were drawn in by iagos wit. sound designer g.w. rodriguez doesnt help cheesemans serious moments. music acceptably accompanies scene transitions but it overshadows iagos soliloquies with a foreboding soundtrack unnecessarily undersg his evil plots. rather than enhance the dread in these scenes this approach comes off as a sloppy cheesy device. according to the program this production is set in the near future but lighting designer annie wiegand goes a bit far with her futuristic vision a bizarre set piece constructed of wire and neon blue tube lighting ing a kind of altar that illuminates as iagos plots progress. the best part of the set design is the use of the balcony levels. various characters climb and vault ladders surrounding the audience during scenes of violence and revelry. nancy learys costume design is simple but effective in reflecting this tension with iagos garb reminiscent of an american wwii fighter pilot. not exactly sure this screams near future however. director judy braha notes in the program that setting the play in the future allows the script to explore the ramifications of race gender and power in a setting far from s england. the racial undertones in this play are interestingly portrayed by braha but are overshadowed by gender relations. bowen is not the only person of color in this production and even as bobbie steinbachs brabantia spits racist epithets at him we observe the diversity of her security force. could his offense be his maleness? it seems possible. women occupy the traditionally male power roles paula langton plays the duke all senators are female and most of the military force is female. s power struggle over his marriage is with s mother a battle she loses. meanwhile though female actors outnumber the men in this production it is the male powerhouses who drive the agency. despite the appearance of a matriarchal system it is iagos words that whip all of cyprus into a frenzy and it is the women who watch helplessly as  escapes the punishment of the state by suicide. braha successfully transforms the prejudices prominent in the script into a new and complex consideration of gender and race. the production is a racy emotional experience and the audience is left reeling with what artistic director allyn burrows calls tectonic shifts in human nature drastic changes we hope will never touch our lives. ,3,Tragedy,Negative
Othello,"The Force, Beauty, and Originality of Verdi's Otello",Denise Battista,san  opera creates a spectacular work of art out of guiseppe verdis masterpiece otello. this is music director nicola luisottis third production at sf opera and perhaps his most impressive and involved score of the season. luisotti and the company orchestra bring out all the passion emotion conflict and consequence of verdis work emphasizing the intricate relationship between music and the action on the stage. this is a production to attend twice once for the experience of the opera as a whole and then again for the music alone. from  to verdi not much changes in this tragedy. verdi does cut the first act and thus the role of s father  eliminating the initial conflict and issues of race and seduction. verdi also develops iago as a true villain extinguishing any question we may have in s play as to iagos motivation for treachery. director stephen barlow sets this production in 18th century cypress and although the time period doesnt make a whole lot of sense it also doesnt detract from the opera. costume design is of course 18th century dress but its not overdone and remains a suitably understated accent throughout. production designer  gunters set is reminiscent of londons globe theatre until a complete set change in act fours bedroom scene with a rounded tri level stage constructed of wooden pillars and latticed panels opening this palette for an array of angles and patterns cast by duane schulers lighting design. the mixture of lighting and set design creates a complex array of moods and emotions on the stage. talent is in abundance with both singers and orchestra equal in relevance and grandeur. act one opens with a burst. the chorus of commoners and soldiers move with the growing fury of a great tempest inducing otellos battle at sea with the turks. lightning blinds and the tempest rages with crashing cymbals strings and fiery flashes from flutes and piccolos. the chorus rides and responds to the waves of this storm. dio fulgor della bufera oh god the blinding storm  the storm subsides and south african tenor johan botha as otello makes a grand entrance as trumpets flourish his victory at sea. the people rejoice around a fire dancing and singing and burning an image of the turks to the tune of flutes and plucky violins. bothas voice is as heroic and powerful as his presence. although verdi initially considered naming his opera iago it is otellos visible and auricular turmoil that drive this tragedy. bothas voice is not that of a sweet voiced romantic tenor but of an heroic soldier packed with valor and dignity although botha taps into that sweet romantic tendency during his kiss duet with  zvetelina vassileva. botha captures the angst and the abysmal grief of otello encompassing the roles of war hero lover and finally the ill fated green monster in the end. italian baritone marco vratogna iago may have influenced verdis decision on naming this opera had he performed for the composer himself. vratogna slithers onto the stage in act one nearly unseen lurking behind pillars and in the shadows. he engages  tenor beau gibson and the chorus in an operatic brindisi delivered in b minor. beethoven labeled b minor as the black key because it implies suffering melancholy and passive complaint. its difficult if not impossible to sympathize with iago in verdis opera and more likely we should assume the suffering and melancholy are the futures of iagos victims. gibsons response in this brindisi is bright and festive in the easy key of b major undersg iagos manipulative control. vratognas lively though sinister chromatic scale of anaphonic laughter ah ah ah in allegro concertato style is echoed by the chorus and swirling orchestra as  literally falls into a drunken haze. and if there is still any question as to iagos nature vratogna his face hit with harsh lighting delivers his evil embracing soliloquy like credo in the beginning of act two downstage and directly to the audience accompanied by the chaotic trill of the woodwinds. he will later taunt and destroy otello with the infamous handkerchief waving it above otello as botha clings to the latticed panels below as though grasping for the frail framework of his very life. vratogna then sneers at otello in his moment of epileptic weakness singing ecco il leone here is the lion while nudging bothas face with his boot his vicious and sarcastic tone again underscored by a low trill from the orchestra. this deep and dark baritone truly frightens. and he destroys not only otello but also a love that was at least for a moment in time beautiful and pure. the kiss duet between botha and bulgarian soprano vassileva at the end of act one is immaculate and all the more emotional with the knowledge of what will befall the lovers. staged beautifully with botha and vassileva seated stage right creating a trine with their bodies heads together in the shape of one perfect entity they sing the story of their lives together of their admiration and end with their love and desire un bacio un bacio anora un bacio a kiss a kiss again a kiss. this is the only pure and peaceful moment in otello. the orchestra is hopeful and anticipatory but it is this happiness and serenity otello bids farewell to at the end of act two when he falls into jealousy. the kiss duet also introduces a powerful melody that repeats twice in the final act of the opera  when otello enters s bedroom and again when he commits suicide. the tender melody is a strong and painful reminder of all otello has lost and tragically destroyed. vassilevas portrayal of  is dramatically lovely. independent of a couple of unexpected sour notes her voice is sweet yet mature giving some welcome strength to  perhaps best portrayed in act three when she must defend herself from otellos strong accusations and heavy hand. vivid is the moment botha attacks vassileva throwing her on pew like benches as though to ravage her. prevalent throughout the opera are split screens if you will with dual action occurring on stage filling the house with conflicting and mixed emotions. as iago plants the initial seeds of jealousy in otellos ear in act two  descends from above like an angel all in white as a rustic chorus of children accompanied by onstage reed instruments and mandolins gather around to praise and adore their mistress. also mesmerizing and forever memorable is the handkerchief quartet during which iago seizes the handkerchief from  renée tatum. vratogna tatum vassileva and botha are present on stage right to left for this powerful quartet each wrapped up in their own emotions with botha stage left falling deeper and deeper into his jealous abyss as he bids farewell to any vein of happiness. act two ends with a continuation of this heroic military march as vratogna and botha vow their allegiance to one another a scene many  critics say is a perversion of the offstage wedding vows otello recently took with . violins bass and brass overtake the moment in a punctual and adrenaline inducing finale to act two. blood red lighting floods the stage and with a violent flamenco like turn toward one another hand in hand interlocked and raised high the dramatic oath ends with vratogna and botha nose to nose. cymbals crash and the opera house goes black. the final act opens to the trepidation of the woodwinds. the stage is white but for a tall candleholder stage right carrying a single extinguishable flame. a standing mirror sits stage left on which otello will hang his now sheathed sword. a sheer white canopy drops from above creating a triangular backdrop for s white deathbed. anxiety fills this final act and vassileva captures the fear despair and noble acceptance of the ill fated . the willow song is sorrowful and true to s emotional intent though again carries some sour notes from vassileva which are almost forgivable after she sings beginning in recitative form the ave . the sinister contrabassoon invites otello into the room through an unseen back door located behind the sheer drape. bothas silhouette grows larger and more imposing as he moves toward the drape. music not words accompanies bothas heavy and calculated steps from mirror to candle to s bed extinguishing all forms of light along the way. the kiss melody reminds but it does not remedy. the rest  is both monstrous and heartbreakingly tragic. as otello realizes his grave error he becomes s and verdis ultimate tragic hero. when verdis otello premiered in milan in 1887 it received twenty curtain calls. verdis deviation from traditional operatic style proved exciting and the opera was an immediate success. italian operatic tenor italo campanini wrote an impassioned review of the milan premiere published in the new york times on march 20 1887 but he didnt write the review until he attended the milan production twice the second time to experience the full scope of the score. campanini later took the title role in otellos american premiere at the new york academy of music in 1888. san  opera offers a production to attend twice and one hundred and twelve years later otello still offers in the words of italo campanini the force beauty and originality of the aged master  otello runs november 8   december 2 at the san  opera 301 van ness avenue san  ca 94102. information

Othello,TFNA Brings Star Quality to the Small Stage,Roseanne Wells,on 42nd street between 8th and 9th avenues there hangs a small marquee with no bright lights like times square or flashy colors like broadway. in simple black and white it reads . theatre for a new audience presents a bold frank production directed by associate artistic director arin arbus. what the sign lacks in sparkle and pizzazz the show makes up for in powerful acting and clean aesthetic. although the production values are not grandiose the story is clearly expressed and nothing more is required. miranda hoffmans costuming is very effective always accounting for the story. while  often dresses sharp yet simple in shirts and jackets iago sulks in murky brown. his wife  also incorporates brown into her scarlet and rusty color palette toning down her look in deference to her mistress.  is radiant in a light cream raw silk dress fitted excellently but also modestly her costuming making her sensual without overt sexiness. in the final scene hoffman puts both  and  in white perhaps signifying they are both victims of the human condition and its frailties. marcus doshis lighting design des over  ksanders functional set with two doors a balcony tier and a large floor space giving the feeling of a courtyard even during indoor scenes. doshi also creates a sinister and secretive tone by casting iago in shadows from the onset. arbus uses the stage well but since it is thrust so far into the audience the action sometimes lacks uniformity and flow.ned eisenberg brings a very italian iago to the stage. from his accentuated hand gestures to a slip into vocal accent eisenberg plays the stereotypically sleazy italian enhancing the language without surpassing it. when he presses  to believe what he knows about venetian women we trust him as well. eisenberg lures the audience into his confidence often playing to the house as a master instructs an apprentice with one eye on the game and the other making sure he is closely watched. eisenberg hints at a possible infatuation with  another interpretation of iagos already vague motives. lucas hall as  is loyal steadfast and an agile drunk. b.h. harrys fight direction and doug elkins choreography is seamless a splendid scene of drunken disorder turned street fight brimming with instinctive brutality. douglas thompsons  is a powerful intelligent man courteous and gentlemanly while remaining dominant and scrutinizing. he stands exposed to a harsh world judging him in his soft love for  and then for the jealousy that eats away his heart. thompson takes the audience through the wringer of emotions upon learning of his wifes supposed infidelity. he seamlessly moves from joking to serious to despair concealing nothing from the audience or from the conniving iago. after he is poisoned against  thompson embodies the animal that everyone presumed  to be. the actor falls closer and closer to the stage floor as  implodes showing a man turned uncivilized and disabled by himself. has the most threatening attributes to this patriarchal society physical beauty mental acuity and reason.  rylance embodies these qualities genuinely with perfect blonde ringlets and a genteel countenance and the wit to be modest while speaking out among senators. rylance brings hidden vigor to the role passion and intelligence wrapped in feminine grace. in her final scene thompson enters the bedroom with a taper casting a dim spiritual glow. rylance mistakes his reserved conduct for bedroom shyness and she is determined to seduce him until he turns on her. earlier in the play  declares perdition catch my soul but i do love thee and when i love thee not chaos is come again.  loves  but chaos meddles and he cannot live with her or with what he has become despite her constant loving devotion. is also a smart beautiful woman but in this production kate forbes shies from the boldness that usually defines her character. forbes plays  as a demure skittish and recalcitrant woman. this angle isnt obvious until iago slaps her face so hard she trips. bearing the brunt of his abuse lines that are commonly delivered in a sassy and flippant tone become bitter and brave whispers to herself. as she prepares  for bed her speech of wives possible infidelities is not a cheeky speculation or contemplation on her own experiences but a desire to have some small advantage over her own mate to which she is shackled. forbes triumphs when she pieces together iagos role in the murder staring him down when he tries to deny it but iagos self imposed silence defeats all. there is no comfort in this tragedy only regret malice and finality. the stark ending matched by its spectacular emotional power gives this production all the star quality it needs.,4,Tragedy,Positive
Othello,To Be Once in Doubt is To Be Resolved,Claudine Nightingale,the rscs production of  is relatively early in its uk tour when it stops off in hackney for just five days. the production is the first to be directed by the rscs newly appointed artistic associate kathryn hunter founder of theatre de complicite and winner of the olivier award for best actress in 1990 for her portrayal of the millionairess in friedrich durrenmatts the visit. one thing is for certain kathryn is out to take risks and make an impact in her directorial debut as artistic associate. unfortunately not all these risks are successful resulting in a performance that often feels drawn out farcical and lacking in emotional depth.the performance starts out on the wrong foot after dealing with several problems created by a disorganised theatre venue. the cast also suffers a small setback as michael goold scheduled to play iago is currently indisposed the role now being played by alex hassell who was previously cast as . this shuffle has a damaging effect on the play as a whole. there are several unfortunate and understandable flubbed lines but this is not the main problem. for many iago is the essence of a good performance of . he is the lynch pin. in order to make any sense of the tragedy which unfurls there needs to be an iago who is deceptive envious brooding frustrated bitter and incredibly angry with the world and all around him. at least these are the characteristics that should indeed must show through in his soliloquies. without this none of the play makes any sense. hassells iago is not nearly angry enough vicious calculating or threatening enough in his delivery of lines. he pronounces i hate the moor and yet i just do not believe him. this iago appears to act on whim. he lacks the emotional depth desperately needed to drag the audience and their emotions down the path of tragedy.  played by patrice naiamamba is a familiar name in the rsc cast list most recently involved in the incredibly successful history cycle. however i found myself never quite being able to reconcile his presentation of the moor of venice.everything about naiamambas portrayal is over emphasised which is a key flaw of much of this production. instead of honest naivety we see an unthinking protagonist who seems to lack the geniality and intelligence if misguided one would normally associate with . naiamamba demonstrates love for  natalia tena is clearly passionate and this at least helps to create a greater case for the tragedy of s final act but there are just too many moments where his performance seems ineffectual or inappropriate. s angry outbursts upon discovering proof of s deceit fail to emotionally engage the audience his anger is portrayed only in bestial growlings and through rushing the delivery of the text which as a result is occasionally lost. most painful is the final scene just after  kills . as he finally realises he has been tricked he cries out oh fool fool fool whilst outlandishly slapping himself round the face. thus the atmosphere of heart rending tragedy is shattered irreconcilably as the audience descends into laughter.thank goodness for the women in this production they offer both light relief and gravitas. well placed humour comes in the form of kath whitefields  who is a vivacious presence brightening up the lethargy of preceding scenes. tamzin griffin as  also gives a powerful performance. it is easy to imagine the woman presented being tethered to the despicable iago. her performance as she mourns s death is powerful and encourages feelings of tragedy for an audience that struggles to find it elsewhere in this production. robert vernons  despite being an understudy for the part is also a charming and persuasive performance. vernon is particularly effective is his scene lamenting the loss of his valued reputation. his innocent despair is endearing and evokes much sympathy from an audience eager to connect.the set design is an innovative concept the imposing bridge at the start of the play splits in two and is hoisted and tugged around the stage representing pathways and ships at various points. yet more often than not it seems more of a hindrance than a help. the metallic screens used at one point as waves also seem a little self conscious as does the constant freezing of characters on stage. the concept is interesting but the result is a little awkward. the 1950s costuming is a little more successful helping to add some coherence to the production.some aspects of hunters direction are indeed radical. every production of  has to confront the difficult issue of race and hunter takes the admirable approach of hitting it head on. during the evening of the soldiers revelries a blacked up al jolson like character comes on stage and entertains the troops with songs mocking their general the moor. a life size doll representing  then gives birth to a golliwog. whilst the scene is effective in illustrating the dichotomy  suffers day to day as both a respected general and a mocked moor the drama seems more shocking than purposeful. there are occasional moments of elation and stage magic for example the performance of the willow song where billowing sheets and pallid blue lighting create a dream like sequence with beautiful music composed by stephen warbeck and a wandering  singing her lamentable song. but one magical moment of theatre after nearly three and a half hours is far too little far too late.,2,Tragedy,Negative
Othello,Othello Provokes Thought If You Read Between the Lines,Denise Battista, is so often about the black and the white not only insofar as color but in regard to opposition. director lisa son does acknowledge these antitheses in her production male versus female illusion versus reality good and evil and the list goes on but she also incorporates the gray area in between these stark contrasts. its this gray area the characters in the play ignore and the consequence is tragic. variations of the words lie and truth run rampant throughout the play and the word honest is spoken forty two times and almost every time about iago. but at the heart of this production lies the brain and the fact that thinking rather than knowing is a mortal mistake. christopher acebos costume design is streamlined jacobean with men wearing leather doublets and long coats as opposed to the women who appear in soft flowing silks. color plays a role with  in white then green perhaps to signify jealousy? and later colors to correspond with s black and white accented in gold. iago appropriately wears black. s costuming stands out from the rest as he appears in brown throughout the production. resident teaching artist david thompson enjoying his 17th season at osf poses an interesting interpretation of this color choice in a world of stark contrasts where  is pure good iago is pure evil and  descends from goodness to evil  danforth comins stands out as a somewhat good but very flawed character. it would have been so easy for  to portray him as another noble and completely innocent victim of iagos malice. instead  goes out of his way to portray his crudeness and insensitivity in the scenes with  here played by stephanie beatriz. so for him to be the first character to walk onto a stage starkly devoid of color and be clothed in a very middle of the road light brown struck me as a purposeful choice. comins or dashing dan as i like to call him is a bit of a stage stealer. his drunken fight scene is well staged and chaotic with barrels flying swords swinging right and left hooks and kicks. comins is perhaps too big for this lesser role or perhaps he is exactly perfect for playing  the swaggering florentine with looks charm and excellent manners although the poor boy cant hold his liquor as he dashes off the stage to thank you for coining the word  puke. color becomes even more interesting when s dress changes to correspond with s brown. this begs the audience to question their relationship and also in light of thompsons reasoning her flawed nature. set design is simple yet severe. the elizabethan stage is much darker with the doors and windows of its three levels bordered left and right with thin florescent strip lighting that tends to blare and blind in response to iagos medicine. at other times and in contrast torches soft glowing lanterns and even sparklers twirled during  and s charming nuptial celebration warm the stage as the attendees dance. most intriguing if you happen to hear what it is supposed to represent is the platform center stage. scenic designer rachel hauck has created a set that she says has a center split down the middle like the two halves of a brain explains thompson. when you walk into the theatre youll see pretty much the basic elizabethan façade but what is usually tudor brown and half timbered looks very very black and white in this particular set and you have these two white platforms center stage with a black strip down the middle. so what does it mean to perform the bulk of this play while standing on top of a brain? makes you think no? this platform becomes even more interesting when considering how this production deals with s spotlighted epileptic seizure that affects the right side of his body and thus the left side of his brain. the left hemisphere of the brain deals with such things as language listening reading logic and analysis all skills  loses during the play. the strip down the middle is synonymous with the part of the brain called the corpus callosum interestingly referred to as white matter across which much of the interhemispheric communication of the brain is conducted. keep in mind that cutting the corpus callosum is a procedure performed in order to reduce the symptoms of severe epilepsy. when   macon and  sarah rutan profess their love for one another in front of her father and the senate they stand on opposite sides of the line face one another and join hands rutan stage left macon stage right. later when  makes iago dan donohue his lieutenant macon and donohue kneel on either side of the line facing one another with their foreheads touching. in both instances the line is cd in order to connect two halves and make a whole. in his first season at osf  macon plays  as a strong bold noble smart and passionate man of presence and extremes. his eloquence as well as he crumbles before our eyes as what he thinks and what he knows battle for survival. macons portrayal is heartbreaking and the pronounced contrast of character from beginning to end makes him all the more tragic. in order for  to be a tragic hero we must somehow relate to him his plight and the albeit poor decisions he makes throughout the play. macon achieves this connection right down to his very last breath gaining both sympathy and uncomfortable empathy from the audience. sarah rutan is the perfect match for macon bringing her own personality and presence to . rutan is fiery yet feminine and strong both mentally and physically. the connection and joy between rutan and macon is overwhelmingly apparent in the beginning of the production. the end is not pretty it is frightening and violent as rutan kicks screams runs and literally fights for her life. although both  and  are victims neither macon nor rutan bring a victim mentality to the stage. its refreshing to see such a strong and heroic portrayal of  versus the more commonly played helpless naïve yet willful woman. rather than irritate by her weakness rutan empowers  with her strength. rutan sings willow in a real voice with occasional cracks yet haunting and ethereal reminiscent of the way kate winslet sang in the midst of her madness as  in branaghs film version of . but neither of our tragic heroes is a match for iago and o what an iago he is. dan donohue has been heavy hitting at osf for the past nine seasons successfully tackling tragic comedic historic and heroic roles on his path to becoming a sought out favorite. donohues manipulations are fascinating to watch and his iago is frighteningly difficult to dislike. at one moment he paints a concerned smile on his face encouraging  to ask  to help him reinstate his lost title. exit comins stage left and donohue whips his head around and looks at the audience in dumbfounded silence as though to say can it really be this easy to fool a fool? his manipulation of  christopher duval is so simple its fascinating. he merely stands behind duval center stage devilishly speaking into his left ear and then into his right. as  fights to find out what iago thinks about  donohue and macon engage in a duel for exercise rather than battle using wooden poles. during this scene variations of the word think are spoken over twenty times. the two circle the stage  with less strategy and more impulsive fury their movement corresponding to the thoughts whirling around in his brain. the scenes end is most strategic as donohue gains control of both poles and holds one in each hand parallel to his body as if to say read between the lines.  does just that but he reads wrongly. the play turns horror film for a flash. after  stabs  donohue is so pleased and seems to reach down into his blackened soul as he grabs a sword drags its blade up the black line splitting the corpus callosum while piercing his evil eyes into the audience before murdering . it is only at this moment that iago is portrayed as truly powerfully and completely evil and the moment terrifies. after the chaos of s death and before  takes his own life  stabs iago. donohues response is simple yet profound as he lands his right hand on top of macons head. words follow as the mystery of the handkerchief is revealed and  finally recovers his eloquence in time to silence himself forever.  doesnt have a  to tell his story. the closest thing he has to the truth is honest iago. the rest is silence.,5,Tragedy,Positive
Othello,Othello Definitely Not a Wash-Out,Claudine Nightingale,the globe theatre can always be relied upon to present productions of a high standard and this years  is certainly no exception. this is the first production of  to be performed at the globe with a black actor playing the title role. not only that but iago is being played by the highly respected tim mcinnerny who is most well known for his parts in the hit british comedy the black adder.  having heard that mcinnernys performance as iago is his best yet i was eager to see for myself. the challenge of playing iago is a sizeable one for any actor. whilst he is certainly one of the more enjoyable an characters to play the problem of how to demonsatrate why he is so full of hatred and jealousy always looms overhead. thankfully mcinnerney does this better than i had even expected. his audience believes in him they gain insight into his anger with life and join him in the torment of his insatiable jealousy of all those around him. as is always the case at the globe it is a truly interactive experience drawing the crowd into the action   especially the groundlings in the yard   with cast members entering through the standing crowds from all sides and explosions overhead that startle even the most suspecting audience member. subtle music offstage also adds an important atmospheric enhancement. the elizabethan style costumes and carefully recreated surroundings provide an arena for an performance unrivalled by no other. the sense of anachronism is almost entire the odd plane soaring overhead disregarded creating the perfect surroundings to lose yourself in the performance before you.  black humour is the interpretation of iago and s several dialogues. in some ways these passages allow the audience to enter a lighter few moments within the dark atmosphere of the plays gloomy meta narrative. yet these moments are also demonstrative of iagos behaviour toward those more naive than him and show his hatred of . iagos manipulation of  is essentially to bring about the downfall of . still s performance is a refreshing aspect of the play leaving him both beautifully and lovingly betrayed.  eamonn walkers portrayal of  is a formidable one however in the delivery of his speech explaining how he won over  we see that his arduous life justifies the fearsome man that walker presents.   stahl also gives a commanding performance as s angered and betrayed father his lines delivered with the utmost natural eloquence.  the drunken scene is a real highlight instantly atmospheric and utterly believable providing evidence of how iago though such a deceitful man in the eyes of the audience appears amongst his friends as the most jovial of companions.  in particular comes to the fore in this scene with some convincing and energetic fighting after which he laments the loss of his reputation. the fact that iago targets the very thing that  values the most is exemplary of iagos terrible skill in attacking what is most important to others.  as is often an occurrence at british open theatre performances the glorious sunshine of earlier in the day turned into a torrential thunderstorm. as the groundlings became drenched there was a tangible danger that the cast were losing the audiences concentration. this was valiantly overcome however by both walker and mcinnerny spontaneously altering line emphases to bring about laughter from the soggy spectators. mcinnerny even made the kind and humorous gesture of throwing a towel to one particularly drenched audience member whilst taking his bow.  such is the prevailing atmosphere of the whole performance   through rain came audience laughter as through tragedy a tinge of comedy still shines through.,4,Tragedy,Positive
Othello,Stratford Othello Does Nothing to Bolster Its Reputation,Tanya Gough,the current stratford festival  is a conservatively staged production with a virtually bare stage ed only by a metal walkway across the back. furniture is kept to a minimum with a few boxes sitting in as various benches and architectural features. costumes are period which will make purists happy with occasional moroccan and exotic flourishes. the staging too is minimal leaving a prime opportunity for this production to highlight the plays most important feature the language. language in  is paramount. the plot hinges on it.  expert at war and strategy is brought down by language but also woos  the same way enticing her with his exotic tales and adventures.  bemoans the loss of his reputation or good name. iagos beef against  is based on a simple rumor nothing more. unfortunately the stratford production seems to ignore these matters in its race to the finish. philip akins  is certainly dynamic and attractive but his initial scenes have him speaking so quickly and fluently his rough of speech passage is laughable. his tale of wooing  is lost too for instead of punctuating the beautiful exotic language and allowing the audience to be drawn to him akins runs through it like a grocery list he is anxious to dispatch. jonathan goad on the other hand presents us with an iago who is rough and brutal both physically and linguistically so while he comes to life with intense brutality during his soliloquies he is so reticent in his dealings with others that he seems more disengaged than disingenuous. although both actors improve in the second half too often passion is translated into physical out bursts and shouting again at the expense of language. as akins becomes wonderfully unhinged so does his speech though he would be more effective if he could convey madness with less sputtering. goad has moments of sheer brilliance as when he seethes with violence and loathing when he says he hates the moor. interestingly goad tends to come alive during the soliloquies which is where akins falters the most. claire jullien disappoints as  approaching the role with an odd sense of maternal restraint which fails to convey the sense of naiveté and youthfulness required by the role. instead jullien comes across as shrill and nagging with a world weary air. unfortunately this approach undermines the play as a whole since without a prevailing sense of s innocence the irony and tragedy of the play are lost entirely. it doesnt help that the death scene is awkward and completely unbelievable or that jullien is victim to the only glaringly bizarre costume choices including a terribly unflattering black sequined bubble hat shapeless tunics and bustle skirts. the production is bolstered by strong performances by jeffrey wetsch  and gordon s. miller . wetschs  is dynamic and affable and yet still carries off his drunken scene believably. millers portrayal of  s the only time i have ever seen the part developed into a three dimensional character worthy of note. on the downside stephen russell seems to be playing  as a feeble old man but unfortunately ends up conveying boredom and disinterest instead. he treats the news of s elopement as a simple frustrating inconvenience rather like discovering hes lost his house keys yet again. lucy peacocks  is brash brazen and oddly uncomfortable on stage until the final act when she finally exhibits some protective maternal emotion. as a whole this  is a conservative by the book production fairly typical of director david lathams other stratford work cymbeline timon of athens. the staging is oversimplified and the metal walkway at the back underutilized. latham also has a penchant for the tableau at the expense of storytelling most notably in the death scene where both  and  have to negotiate their way awkwardly into position and lose the dramatic power of their deaths as a result. this is an oddly dispassionate  and at just under three hours one of the fastest ive ever seen. there is hope that by late july or early august this show might settle into a moderately decent albeit basic production but at the moment this is a notably unreable piece of theatre.,3,Tragedy,Negative
Julius Caesar,"Men, Women, and Power: Great Lakes' Julius Caesar",Yuko Kurahashi,originally performed in london in 1599 amid the tudors succession crisis this historical play about leadership and succession set at the end of the roman republic reflects sixteenth century england. the great lakes theater production in turn resonates with the uncertainty of the late 2010s. director sara bruner emphasizes the juxtaposition of the lack of women as leaders in the roman republic and their presence in power positions in the twenty first century through the casting of women for the characters of   and . in the program notes bruner says she casts women in the roles of  and  to examine what happens when women gain access to power in a male dominated world. gender bending casting    played by laura welsh berg as a female senator   played by carole healey as a female  and s wife husband in this show played by m.a. taylor   is also a testament to the great lakes theaters ongoing effort to raise the visibility of the companys female actors. for example the company staged  in 2017 with the double casting of male and female actors for the title role. lynn robert berg as  emphasizes his ideals and the impulsive sides of the character. he reveals his internal conflicts as laura welsh bergs  manipulates him while his wife  jillian kates tries to move his conscience. the relationship between the two reflects the contemporary military in which both men and women are involved in combats and decision making. however one may wonder if lynn robert bergs casual and sometimes mocking gestures to laura welsh berg are the result of the directorial and acting choice to emphasize their power struggle or of the actors real life connectedness as spouses. carole healey portrays a self confident . dressed in a white tunic breeches and light brown leather armor healeys  is neither an empress nor a queen but someone who has fought their way to power. nick steens portrayal of   at s funeral in act iii scene 2 is the highlight of the show. he aptly uses the verbal subtlety to change the minds of the mob and turn them against the conspirators. bruner cuts the lines of the tribunes  and marullus in the first scene some of their lines are spoken by another strong female character the  jodi dominick. she warns the citizens chanting of   off stage about their opportunism. dominicks  casts an eerie atmosphere over the entire show. bruner and scenic designer russell metheny created a bleak multi leveled architectural stage using four metal towers on the movable platforms in front of a back wall with five upper windows and a rolling step ladder which serves as the podium as well as the steps in the senate. the movable towers are used by the actors to suggest nooks niches and porticos in the streets and the roman forum where the characters gather secretly to exchange information and to plot. the actors seen through the windows deliver their characters lines to underscore the difference in opinions and positions. suitable to this abstract setting is the presentational depiction of bloodshed as red ribbons are pulled from the characters costumes. this stylistic presentation of violence allows the audience to pay attention to without the distraction caused by a realistic portrayal of murders. the costumes designed by leah piehl suggest ancient rome while keeping them eclectic.  and his conspirators wear tunics breeches leather armors and leather boots. the triumvirate of   aled davies and  julian remulla wear black coats with aiguillette pants berets and boots. their soldiers wearing helmets look like a contemporary swat team. the citizens wear non period specific costumes such as shawls headscarves ankle length skirts and breeches. lighting designer rick martin creates an ominous and dangerous world first century bce rome by using a mixture of warm and cool lights with a variety of textures. the strobe lights and rhythmic music composed by matthew webb accentuate different weather and locales of the storm and battle scenes. the last scene   a battlefield in phillipi   foreshadows  imminent rise to the first emperor of the roman empire by a single spotlight where he stands. this tableau also predicts the fate of  and  who are soon to be destroyed. unfortunately bruners intention to examine and present womens ambitions followed by the male centered societys response to them was unaccomplished. in this reviewers opinion it was simply because the original lines by  illuminate the physical verbal and psychological tactics in actual and political battles that determine victors and losers instead of allowing for a thorough examination of womens ambitions successes and struggles to become the center of the play. great lakes theater in cleveland opened   on october 4 2019 at the hanna theatre in cleveland ohio in repertory with the music man.,4,Tragedy,Positive
Julius Caesar,Hail an Original Caesar!,Benjamin Alper,with its exploration of the nature of power democracy and politics most modern productions of   feel compelled to overemphasize certain aspects of the play to try and make a contemporary political statement the 2017 new york production depicting  as donald trump immediately comes to mind. while such overt comons can provide a fun and interesting way to engage with this play they can also overwhelm the production and distract from the inherent excellence of s work. the atlanta  companys current production of  performed at the  tavern playhouse refreshingly lets the play speak for itself allowing the audience to enjoy the play without trying to color our interpretation of it. although   contains some of s most memorable lines it is infrequently staged in large part because the play starts off slowly and doesnt really get going until s fateful and fatal encounter with the conspirators on the senate floor. this bloody event doesnt occur until midway through the play so it is incumbent upon the actors to build the action and keep the audience engaged. thankfully this production consists of an excellent cast that was more than equal to the task.  not the plays namesake  is the most compelling character on the stage. the actor portraying  j. l. reed must be able to deftly and subtly convey to the audience the characters internal struggles and evoke both ire and sympathy from the audience at different moments. much like the romans in the play a good production of   will have the audience alternating between their disdain for  and their reverence for him and reeds portrayal of  hits this  perfectly. from the onset  uneasiness at s growing power is communicated to the audience along with how he emotionally wrestles with his deadly decision whether or not to betray  for the sake of rome is captured beautifully by reed. not to be outdone daniel parvis portrayal of  is equally enthralling. as the main antagonist to  in the second half of the play parvis also must portray s internal struggle to both placate the conspirators to stay alive while honoring and remaining loyal to the memory of his friend and patron. many productions portray  as more of a machiavellian figure but parvis performance was as credible as it was compelling. s red hot rage at the death of  was palpable and his subsequent ability to sway the roman people at s funeral felt genuinely earned and not the consequence of mere rhetorical tricks played upon a foolish citizenry. the rest of the cast is exceedingly excellent as well. marcus hopkins turner as  was reable for his onstage presence as one who believes the world truly revolves around him as indeed it did for a brief time. kenneth wigley and amy levin as the conspirators  and  are also outstanding convincing the audience of the justness in their cause as much as they convinced . effectively using lighting and sound effects to heighten the dramatic tension particularly during the storm scene at the beginning of the play mary ruth ralstons direction is top notch. the intimate setting of the  tavern playhouse s perfect for this production as it brings the audience into the play and makes us all roman citizens for the evening. the final battle scene was also expertly choreographed as it featured the entire cast battling in such a small space. in a time when all entertainment seems to have a political subtext its inspiring to see a production of   that lets the audience enjoy the play without forcing us to subscribe to a particular political statement or philosophy. rather than telling us what we should think about this play this wonderfully cast and beautifully executed production lets us decide for ourselves.,5,Tragedy,Positive
Julius Caesar,Trends Foretold in Media Theatre’s Political Julius Caesar,Jennifer Kramer,with a slogan like make rome great again blazoned over their website and the theatres marquee the media theatre is clearly not shying away from using their production of   to confront contemporary american politics. however the manner and matter of their message proves to be more complicated than the straightforward reference would suggest resulting in an intriguingly complex production. the first suggestion that things are not what they seem comes from matthew millers scenic design. a projection screen at the very back of the stage begins by showing the senates meeting place   the us senate that is. the screen follows with other unambiguously american political scenes to establish the setting particularly the rotunda of the capitol and displays epigraphs from the declaration of independence fdr and patrick henry. however the rest of the stage shows a level of decay and disrepair at odds with the images of gleaming white marble rusty pillars leaning askew or lay toppled on the ground piles of garbage surrounding a headless statue and graffitti decorating crumbling brick walls a podium for public address made out of rickety wood and surrounded by wartime camouflage netting. a banner boasting the seal of the president of the united states also contains the roman eagle and spqr a communist banner with a hammer and gear features the capitoline wolf. the anarchist a alone seems to be untouched by context. the dark and dirty set dressing is made even more bleak with a perpetual haze of smoke and steven speras moody lighting design. despite the shows tagline costume designer ryn smith avoids any direct references to donald trump for s outfits the loose fitting silhouette of his suit feathered receding hair and expensive affectations like fur coats suggest similarities without committing to them. the rest of the costume design continues the theme of a bleak alternate universe portraying a strict sartorial caste system of plaid plebeians leather   and the other younger senators and business suit  calpurnia  and the other older politicians. though biker leathers would seem to be naturally at odds with business formal these two groups mix with ease s moto jacket is as fitted and expensive as s suit and  leather blazer could almost pass in the workplace. the distinctions in the patricians dress are no obstacle to their political maneuverings meanwhile the rowdy mob of working class flannel wearers exist only to be given orders as servants or to be manipulated by orators into running amuck. while the sets and costumes are more subtle indications of the productions refutation of its own first impressions the performances are direct subversions. zoran kovcics  is interestingly low key his flashes of petulance and anger at potentially missing being crowned give the impression not so much of ambition but of privileged expectation. kovcic also shows how easily he is swayed first by calpurnias the melania accented serena vesper literal seduction then by   lisa villamil somewhat more metaphorical one. kovcic exudes an ambiguity that makes it impossible to tell if  is overconfident in his normally astute political abilities or overconfident in nonexistent ones that have until now been offset by unusually good luck. damon bonetti as  meanwhile offers a similarly equivocal performance. he exudes a vague affability to  friends and foes alike to the extent that it is impossible to tell how  truly feels about them. likewise bonetti portrays  as clearly disturbed by s potential crowning but delivers his soliloquy in ii.1 without much in the way of passionate conviction before concluding with a certain amount of resignation. bonetti gives him the air of playing the good guy at the expense of actually realizing his good intentions and accomplishing his goals. the contrast to the more volatile personalities that surround both kovcic and bonetti like charlotte northeasts cheerfully caustic  or villamils poisonously insincere   is almost but not quite overwhelming an effect that heightens the feeling that  and  are both being swept away by the tides of history. in a nicely effective bait and switch the production does finally feature a trump like demagogue rising from social power to make an unexpected political bid by appealing to the angers and fears of the populus   jennie eisenhower. eisenhower transforms from laidback to gleefully destructive increasing the chaos as s and  plans become increasingly irrelevant to the bloodthirsty citizens around them. as the unapologetically brazen slogan might suggest director bill van horns vision is flashy and concentrated on its central conceit. the pacing is somewhat languid and this production does not focus on the characters emotional interactions. while some small touches like the conspirators posing for instagram selfies with s corpse strike the correct balance of horror and satire other gimmicks are too excessive to be truly effective like accompanying s assassination with the music from psycho or having the mob apparently cannibalize  the poet. but van horn has a clear thesis for his production that smooths over the rough patches the pretense of suggesting a straightforward political reading with make rome great again only to subvert those expectations strengthens the theme that there is no black and white breakdown of events and motivations. as the play progresses van horn does not reflect current american politics so much as a projected worst case scenario for certain current trends. the infrastructure crumbles as partisan infighting among the politicians escalates to the point of personal vendettas and finally violence and civil war meanwhile the disaffected mobs riot not for a particular cause but for whoever expresses the strongest relatable emotion. patriotism is used as currency and policy is nowhere to be found. although it takes five acts for the republic to fall it started to die before the play even began. the result is a full on dystopia but one whose origins are chillingly familiar. van horns political messaging may be bold but rather more bipartisan than one might expect the production is not interested in assigning blame to any specific party but to the destruction anyone could produce if they tried or didnt try hard enough. the media theatres production of   is political in the best way taking the conflicting viewpoints of a historical democracy in crisis a pro monarchist playwright and a modern democracy with troubles of its own showing the cost of violence and chaos and letting the audience decide whether any greatness can be salvaged before its too late.,4,Tragedy,Positive
Julius Caesar,All Republics Fall,Jennifer Kramer,of the many possible reactions to the works of   needs more historycharactersdialogue is probably one of the least common. however this has not stopped the quintessence theatre from expanding  . with additions from  masefields the tragedy of pompey the great joseph addisons cato and the tragedy of s revenge their production includes an exploration of the historical and literary context alongside one of s most well known tragedies. the actors keep the production from feeling glutted by some tight role doubling. michael gamache opens the play as a sympathetic pompey portraying him as loyal to rome but openly frustrated by the years of civil war stemming from the corruption of the senators commanding him. gamache reappears as  in a brief but humorously supercilious turn as one of those problem senators and then finally as a stoic  once again fighting a losing battle on behalf of the republic. brett ashley robinson meanwhile cycles through the play as zealous supporters of  her dedicated if somewhat smug acilius leading up to an incendiary  . though robinson occasionally has problems with the lines her ardent declamation of s eulogy perfectly encapsulates s mix of passion and casual ruthlessness. michael brusasco as  and mary tuomanen as  offer solid performances as the lead conspirators though it takes until the argument in act iv scenes 2 3 to fully convey both the depth of  emotion and the chemistry of their friendship. paul hebron as  however seems to more deliberately keep to the background. despite the play opening with major players treating  as a military and social threat hebron portrays him with such affable reasonableness that its easy to see both how he gained such loyalty and became such a threat. it is only during his rejection of calpurnia tom carman that hebron lets the pleasant façade slip and reveals the cruelty and ambition driving  forward. the set designed by director alexander burns is a pleasingly minimalist combination of modern and elizabethan staging. the back of the stage is a traditional structure with two curtained doorways and a platform above but the lack of thrust stage is compensated for by using parts of the house which also serves to subtly include the audience among conspirators and rebel armies alike. the white structure makes an excellent screen to project title cards and maps and combined with the black curtained wings and stage makes a nicely ironical statement in a play that revels in the lack of black and white answers. the only source of confusion is when the backdrop splits apart for octavians dramatic entrance revealing a burst of riotous color from the storage backstage and giving the confusing and fleeting impression that he has miraculously sprung from some paradise to grace the world of mortal men. like the set jane casanaves costume design also tends to the straightforward. the production is modern dress though indeterminate enough to comfortably fit into most of the twentieth and twenty first centuries including discords guy fawkes like mask which oscillates freely between its traditional imagery of defeated anarchy and the modern association with anti establishment activist groups. the roman elite who take their wars seriously wear camouflage fatigues in the field otherwise they appear in somewhat old fashioned suits. the one sour note is the tailoring as it strains belief that such privileged and fastidious characters would be caught dead in such poorly fitting suits. for important occasions they also add modified togas now a ceremonial garment inherited from times past. even the plebeians outfits reflect the wealth and power of rome producing a well dressed mob in snappy khakis and blazers. burns direction is quick paced and kinetic a particularly impressive and much needed counterbalance given that the production is otherwise light on action. in addition to incorporating other plays burns also showcases the video animation of eyal lerman. title cards sum up the results of military and political battles punctuated by dramatic electronic music then segue into a moving map that both grounds the audience in the events of the play and shows the world spanning breadth of the conflict. however the most obvious additions to the play are people   pompey gamache cato david pica and even the personification of discord pica tuomanen   which quickly establishes the productions focus on the personal interactions that fueled the historical drama. at the same time choosing to begin the play with pompey with selections from act ii of masefields the tragedy of pompey the great frames this as romes tragic flaw individual action cannot stop s influence because he is a symptom of a greater problem. acilius notes that pompey actually shares the same desire as  to limit the aristocracy and introduce reforms and warns that romes government will turn on him rather than willingly purge its corruption the scene ends with orders from the senate countermanding pompeys battle plan and forcing him to fight and lose at pharsalia. years later it is clear that the same corruption still lingers  most emotional speech in the play is from act iv   not against  but  his friend implicated in charges of bribery. multiple scenes with a lone soldier surrounded by politicians in suits the parallels of pompey cato and  the singular honest men taking a stand against s faction even the same actors resurfacing in various roles   the production portrays a grim cycle that grinds down opposition until the whole structure fails. octavians prominence at the conclusion of the play s the conclusion of the sovereignty of the senate and people of rome with his full title as emperor projected across the stage followed by an epitaph for the roman republic. the quintessence theatres production of   is an impressive undertaking an astutely observed political thriller as well as an epic tragedy. the

Julius Caesar,CSF’s Julius Caesar Traditional But Still Relevant,Ginny Quaney,s   has been in the news lately due to that kerfuffle or is it covfefe? around the public theaters  in the park production earlier this summer which depicted the titular roman ruler as president trump. the colorado  festivals  is nowhere near so controversial yet manages to prove the continued relevance of the 400 year old play in spite of the traditional setting. director  powell takes a fairly traditional approach to  setting the play in ancient rome. the costumes consist entirely of tunics togas and sandals   with the exception of the plebeians in the first scene. the show opens with a carpenter and  in modern dress approaching from the audience to address roman soldiers who are trying to calm their celebrations. as the scene progresses more audience members many holding beers or other adult beverages stand and begin to contribute shouts of hail  they pop up like whack a moles leading the audience to distrust even their neighbors identity lest they be a secret roman. while clever and funny the message is clear   we the audience are rome and this is only the first time we realize that fact. the set is simple and minimalist a blank gray slate which can become a bright roman parlor where conspirators plan late into the night a dark apocryphal storm the capitol on the ides of march a bloody battlefield bathed in red and a star filled night sky at the end of the play. the technical effects which include impressively atmospheric light and sound cues do the heavy lifting here and do it well. as always the actors are on point. robert sicular is good as a pompous but unaware . his decision later changed to stay in on the fateful day to ease the fears of his worried wife calpurnia shelly gaza gives us a glimpse of his gentler private side his only crimes seem to be arrogance but who in this play isnt? and trusting his political allies a bit too much. the audience never sees the ambitious monster the conspirators fear. scott coopwoods  comes across as honorable but fatally naive. while his inner struggle is obvious he seems almost too easily swayed by the words of  and the other conspirators. in fact he feels more like  if the moors fatal flaw was optimistic patriotism rather than jealousy. but perhaps that is a result of matthew schnecks delightfully manipulative    his ambiguous motives an implication that his concerns about  may be more personal than he lets on the way he so clearly pulls the strings of all the conspirators and his patient erosion of even s objections evoke iago in the best ways. its difficult not to root for him if only to see his well laid plans come to fruition and especially right after the assassination when  insists on allowing  to speak at s funeral. schnecks delivery of the simple line  a word with you has the audience laughing but anyone who knows how the next act plays out wants to shake  and yell listen to  coopwood and schnecks chemistry first apparent in csfs production of taming as  and grumio respectively makes the conspirator scenes riveting and elevates an otherwise forgettable scene in act 4  and  neck deep in war argue heatedly hurl painful accusations apologize and eventually make up like the bros they are. the raw intensity of emotion and utter reality of the scene is breathtaking. by far the most memorable scene is of course  s friends romans countrymen speech. christopher joel onken who played the one dimensional lucentio in taming gets to show off his chops here. he first enters upon s call by performing a cartwheel and coming up hands on hips half his chest bared and far too much leg showing in his very short tunic. costume designer clare henkel should get kudos for that inspired design alone. his public persona prior to s assassination is one of exuberant youth and braggadocio which makes his transformation after all the more fascinating akin to prince hal in s henriad and his private grief and oath of vengeance over s body is both revealing and touching. powell has both  and  speak on platforms in the audience again clearly signifying that we the audience are the people. but while coopwoods  is wonderfully reserved and reasonable onken nails the gentle faux humble lend me your ears the intensifying snark of  is an honorable man and the proud knowledge of just what hes unleashed by the end. the audience although we are the roman people are also just removed enough to recognize in s speech the type of rhetoric politicians have used for 2000 years to convince people to rally to a cause. in spite of its well known outcome powell manages to make the scene of s assassination tense and suspenseful through a brilliant combination of ominous light cues intense music and blocking   the conspirators raise their knives only to hide them again and their circle increasingly tightens as they get closer to taking that final step. when they do the result is a manic bloodlust as  bounces from knife to knife ending up covered in blood which literally drips down the steps of the capitol. only s levelheadedness keeps them from massacring everyone from servants to  afterward. i was surprised to find my heart pounding and a ball of anxiety in my stomach throughout the entire scene even though i knew full well what would happen. powells direction excels in two other areas. the first is the fight choreography for which credit should also go to christopher duval the fight director   on a stage reddened by the lights actors fight in a stylized group dance first against one opponent and then to another no fights or characters highlighted. just one big fog of war. the second is the ability to highlight minor characters without distracting. most of the conspirators were distinguishable from one another each having their own business even when not speaking    casey andree was delightfully gossipy and his scene with  and  describing  being offered the crowd felt almost like watching modern day middle schoolers gossip not roman senators discuss politics. anne penner induced chills with the s few lines and ian roy fraser as s servant  was a joy to watch as he kept attempting to stay and listen in on the conspirators conversations. csfs   proves that controversy isnt needed for relevance   400 years later s words continue to ring true. correction 72717 the costume designers name was incorrectly stated. the correct name has been updated.,4,Tragedy,Positive
Julius Caesar,Ambition to be Glanced at in PSF’s Julius Caesar,Jennifer Kramer,great playwrights dont preach says patrick mulcahy producing artistic director of the pennsylvania  festival and director of their production of  . often through immersion in ambiguity and paradox they illuminate truths about our being that transcend binary considerations of right and wrong. this ethos very clearly informs the production whether or not the result is transcendent is much less clear. scenic and lighting designer steve teneycks set is the most successful representation of ambiguity and paradox. following mulcahys vision of a production highlight[ing] elements of past present and imagined future the set echoes the design of classical architecture with a looming colonnade and podium. these stand over the elizabethan thrust stage and the unrelieved white color echoes the neoclassical vision of greece and rome whose brightly painted surfaces were lost to time and over zealous restorers. meanwhile the strict geometric design square piers instead of round columns furniture composed entirely of straight lines and material shiny plastic are most definitely modern and call upon the conception of futuristic   particularly in combination with the technology incorporated into its design through lights that provide dramatically colored backlighting and shadows during scene breaks. marla jurglanis costume design attempts a similar blending of time periods though not quite as successfully. between the near universal adoption of combat boots the pleather coats of war and the roman mobs hoodies and skinny jeans and ripped fishnets theres a distinct flavor of future dystopia via hot topic circa 2002. the color palette is very subdued. s banner and sweater are red and his mantle bronze whereas  and his faction favor the shades of gray blue up to navy but these are sparing accents to overwhelming gray and black   perhaps too sparing as the parade of minor characters in the final battle scenes of the play could have used more visual indications of their allegiances. stoles worn like sashes draped around the neck or originating from suit pockets and wrapping around the shoulders offer a compact modernization of the senators togas. interestingly only  and calpurnia have gained the purple they wear modern evening gowns in shades of plum and aubergine accented with flowing floor length vests or housecoats. instead of three piece suits sport coats are worn with shawl neck sweaters and fatigues along with multiple layers toques are also popular giving the impression that this rome is very chilly. the cast adopts a faintly declamatory style that sometimes seems at odds with mulcahys vision of an intimate production and makes several flubbed lines more noticeable. the play arrests the audiences attention with the revels of a bellowing mob   a recurring theme   and the indignant posturing of  and marullus james bo sayre and jacob dresch respectively. by contrast the first appearances of  henry woronicz and  keith hamilton cobb seem almost underwhelming unbalancing the productions beginning. both actors however increase in stage presence as the play progresses. woronicz plays  as a kindly old man fond of his friends and solicitous of his wife and servants eventually revealing the grim determination that apparently propelled him to assassination and civil war. cobb meanwhile portrays a demagogue whose larger than life antics nevertheless seem genuine giving even outrageous proclamations like danger knows full well that  is more dangerous than he a confident sincerity. cobb extends this sincerity to s relationships as well he is openly affectionate tussling with his wife and greeting his friends with hearty back slaps and displays a distinct fondness for sweeping people off their feet with bear hugs   friendly for his allies crushing for his assassins. rosalyn coleman as calpurnia gives gravitas to a minor role as a classic politicians wife the seriousness with which she and beth egan as s servant treat her troubled dreams give them a religious conviction in keeping with roman cultural mores. greg wood  and christopher patrick mullen  attract attention among the conspirators with their sharply defined personalities the former passionate the latter sardonic. spencer plachy gives a standout performance as marc  transforming him from an amiable party boy stumbling onstage still trying to put his shoes on to the impassioned orator devastatingly manipulating the mob into a frenzy with copious amounts of fervor and spittle   a transformation that is electrifying but never abrupt. mulcahy keeps the pace steady and the first half of the production ends on a strong note. throughout the play the passions of the common romans have been consistently emphasized with their celebrations mourning and righteous indignation expressed at top volume by the ensemble. goaded on by s eulogy they prowl through the streets of rome seeking violence. it is dealt out with chilling deliberation to the somewhat obnoxious   though still blameless    the poet and the production seems poised to use this juxtaposition of order versus chaos   the prevention of tyranny versus the promulgation of anarchy   as one of mulcahys examples of ambiguity and paradox. unfortunately this is completely dropped in the second half of the production. nearly all scenes of violence feature the conspirators faction only in one sided stylized slow mo while this makes sense from a practical standpoint given the decidedly lackluster man to man combat during s assassination it loses the visceral sense of the violent fallout from  and s schemes. the metatextual implications of the casting suffer a similar problem. the conspirators appear to be uniformly white men mostly older while  and his supporters include women people of color and the young. identification with the fight against the entrenched power structures of modern society or with the generational divide that fuels everything from thinkpieces about millennials to the sharply divided demographics of the brexit seems almost inevitable. yet the productions take on this remains unsettled the ambiguity that arises is not the result of the complexity of human nature but of unclear implications that fizzle out without any supporting commentary from the play. however the production is not without its successes the pennsylvania  festivals   is a solid showing overall with many enjoyable moments and like  himself fortunate valiant and ambitious. whether or not it can survive its own standards is the ultimate ambiguity and paradox left to the audience.,4,Tragedy,Positive
Julius Caesar,Ambition Should Be Made of Sterner Stuff,Jennifer Kramer,in his notes about his production of the tragedy of   for the lantern theater director  mcmahon discusses the universality of the works themes where a play notionally about one episode in ancient history nevertheless touches upon issues relevant to audiences across the globe for hundreds of years. to highlight that universality mcmahon chose to base the lanterns production on the imagery of feudal japan drawing on the similarities between the zen tradition of the japanese warrior class and the stoicism of the romans. presumably he means the edo period a time of strict social division when japans de facto rulers were the military the shogun and the daimyo supported by the samurai whose code of moral values known by the modern term bushido was and is hugely influential. however this potentially apt setting is undermined by a superficial reading and lack of attention to detail flaws that plague many levels of the production. on a technical level mcmahons direction suffers from several missteps. the stage fighting leaves much to be desired when it comes to representing trained warriors and having the poet  killed by a mob using the offensive capabilities of the three stooges only adds insult to injury. more generally there are some distracting problems with the blocking. not much use is made of the sets interior region and most of the action takes place a little too far downstage thanks to theaters wedge shaped stage several scenes feature pairs of actors who both manage to have their backs to the audience while simultaneously obscuring each other. though mcmahon has worked with small casts to great effect in the past as in last years henry v the doubling of parts in this production is much less successful. suspension of disbelief is difficult to maintain due to the sheer numbers of roles played and many of the secondary characters come off as literally interchangeable. moreover the lack of representation for asian american actors gives the production a distressingly orientalist bent distracting from its otherwise fairly diverse and talented cast. each member of the cast turns in a strong performance but as an ensemble they cannot quite come together. the most pressing issue is that collectively they are some of the least zen samuraistoic romans ever. almost every character is oversupplied with emotional speeches delivered at top volume drowning out more subtle effects and diminishing the individual impact of each characters passion. the biggest casualty of this is u.r.s  he offers an intriguing take on the character affable and long suffering but when his pleasant calm seems to have almost no effect on his excitable friends and family it is difficult to see how their purported high regard can coexist with their apparent lack of respect. forrest mcclendon fares better as  because he can command appropriate reactions s strength of feeling is not uncommon in this rome but mcclendon gives him a physical presence and a charisma even his enemies acknowledge. yet one cannot help but wish for more contrast to allow his portrayal the power it deserves. the cast is certainly capable of delivering more varied performances kittson oneill as the  for example tempers her uncanny mannerisms and supernatural edge with the hint of warmth for  then reverses the dynamic as  whose affection for her husband is steeped with unnerving glimpses of her troubled mental state. however because this confrontation is tonally very similar to the scene between calpurnia mary lee bednarek and her husband the plays distinctions between the characters   the different ways  and  interpret their stoic philosophy calpurnias prescient belief in superstitions versus s greater dedication to his pride   are nearly lost. the costume design by brian strachan suffers a similar loss of nuance he establishes a coherent theme of flowing trousers and colorful mantles and robes but each characters costume seems more or less interchangeable usually lacking any stamp of their individual personalities. there are a few notable exceptions the s veiled sedge hat gives her finery a ghostly appearance while jered mclenigans  refuses to button his shirt and constantly sports a vaguely inappropriate plunging neckline. while one can sympathize that the limits of a productions budget or the quick and easy costume changes required by a doubled cast can definitely conflict with recreating period fashions to a high degree of accuracy there are surely better solutions than for example designing identical mantles for most of the cast whose cut and fabric give them an unfortunate resemblance to hawaiian shirts completely ignoring the actors blatantly modern hairstyles or providing dubious substitutions for the iconic samurai armor. in contrast meghan joness set design is deliberately simple. it combines a vaguely roman pediment with japanese paper lined sliding doors acknowledging both the plays origins and the productions setting. props are minimal limited to a few lanterns banners and sake glasses. overall it works well as a suggestion of the setting hinting at the philosophy of simplicity allegedly on display. another successful component is the productions use of music provided by kyo daiko philadelphias taiko drum ensemble. the pulsing beat lends an urgency to the plays celebrations and scene transitions leavened by the haunting flute melodies played by  servant . the two come together at last during the end of act iv when  lament is co opted by martial drums as s ghost confronts  the music perfectly underscores u.r.s and mcclendons performances and launches the production into the battle scenes of the final act. unfortunately elements like these only highlight the areas where the production does not live up to mcmahon and the lanterns past high standards. given that there are many intriguing parallels between the late roman republic and edo japan it is frustrating that mcmahon fails to exploit most of them in a meaningful way this production of   may be good in theory but proves unexceptional in execution.,3,Tragedy,Negative
Julius Caesar,"Passing on the Baton of Despotism, One Republic to Another ",Eric Minton,i saw a bumper sticker on a car recently that said its not about the right and left its about liberty and freedom. so was this on a tea partyers car or the ride of an ultra liberal? because liberty and freedom are all about perspective whether youre looking from the right or the left whether youre looking up or down. one mans liberty to own a semiautomatic rifle with high capacity magazines of armor piercing bullets is contrary to a little girls freedom from fear. a young mans freedom to attain an education equal to peers in other communities counters a property owning womans liberation from taxes. government regulations are to this person a tyrannical obstruction to the pursuit of prosperity and to that person a necessary guarantor in the pursuit of prosperity. one persons  is another persons . in the electrifying text centric production of   by the american  center at the blackfriars playhouse we see  tackle this dichotic conundrum of republican government. every character acts on behalf of liberty freedom and enfranchisement but in doing so they actually abrogate the liberty freedom and enfranchisement of most romans. in the end two despots and afterward only one are left standing. along the way  presents a wide spectrum of interpersonal relationships that have ramifications on the public state. to describe   as electrifying might itself seem a conundrum to anybody who has had only the typical stage or cinematic experience with this play or suffered through it in high school. but  himself might have intended more of a potboiler than we are used to seeing as evidenced by this production that kicks off the 2013 actors renaissance season at the blackfriars playhouse in staunton virginia. the actors work according to the production process of s original theater company mounting the play without a director or designers on a few days of rehearsal and using only cue scripts. typically in these productions the actors turn even the most pedestrian of  era plays into a photo finish sprint of so many usain bolts.   is no exception. in fact sprint is an apt term here for the production lasts just over two hours as the players engage in mamet like dialogue rat a tat tatting the rhetoric that is the central theme to this play. however rather than being a play about words words words this asc cast gives us a drama of conflicting personalities sometimes within the same character and a political thriller that even though we know the outcome so well plays with a game of thrones urgency. at the center is not the titular character played with self absorbed ego by benjamin curns or even the famous speechmaker marc   jon phelps stepping gingerly through the political minefield but the interplay and innerplay of  and  played respectively by rené thornton jr. and sarah fallon. these two actors have now been paired a dozen times as lovers on the blackfriars stage including benedick and beatrice  and kate  and  aaron and tamora and aeneas and dido. pitting fallon and thornton opposite each other as the hot headed  and ultrahonorable  is the closest asc comes to stunt casting and it achieves breathtaking results. this doesnt mean the two are presented with homosexual overtones but it does mean that as characters in the hands of these two intelligent an actors theirs is a genuine friendship.  displays true affection for  and  regards  with real respect. these feelings keep the two from killing each other in the tent argument even though fallons  is pushed beyond frustration and thorntons  is driven beyond exasperation. this scene becomes heart pounding theater with these two actors not only emoting s verses from the deepest roots of their characters personalities but also working in the fluid rhythm that comes from their long trusting professional relationship on the stage. in fallon we see that  is not just a foaming mouthed fomenter of rebellion who manipulates  into action and then proves helpless in countering his bad decisions that lead to their mutual destruction.  himself says of  that he is a great observer and he looks quite through the deeds of men. fallons  sees danger in  not only for himself but also for people of such good character and repute as . on that he acts. while he comes to consider  to be honorable to a fault he ultimately acquiesces to  decisions out of long held admiration as well as for political necessity fallons  closely watches the other conspirators reacting to  first countermand. in thornton though we see a  whose code of honor becomes as dangerous as the code of self that  exhibits. the difference between these two men is the width of a coin showing opposite images of ego on either side. even as early as act 2 scene 1 when the conspirators meet in  orchard we see  own despotic nature emerge bullying the other conspirators rather than working in consensus with them. if  and  had ultimately succeeded rome likely would have ended up with another egomaniac as omnipotent as  and a still frustrated  looking through the deeds of this  and plotting yet another assassination. instead rome ends up with  and  . the latter played with a steely resolve and a deficit of humor by grant davis is clearly the most impenetrable force among the politicians in this play. we can tell at their first meeting that  despite his greater experience and reputation is doomed in trying to share power with the young upstart. however phelps  is a harder character to read and i came to appreciate this enigmatic portrayal. definitely the party boy at the beginning he seems ready and willing to die at the hands of the conspirators after s assassination. when they dont kill him he starts pushing his own political envelope while warring with the emotions that come from having just seen his mentor and protector murdered. his friends romans countrymen speech comes off as spontaneous an oration hes finding his way through by feel. i am no orator as  is he says and he seems to mean it. the logical progression of s brilliant composition gets on track by its own accord as  speaks it. yet this may be an act.  for all his playboy ways perhaps learned image management from the ultimate master of that skill . as the plebeians run riot after the assassins phelps turns to us the audience and says matter of factly now let it work. mischief thou art afoot take thou what course thou wilt. these are the words of a veteran soldier who knows how to engage a battle and react to whatever course it takes. allison glenzer  harrell daniel kennedy and abbi hawk give us an insightfully comic turn as the plebeians during s speech. s covered body lies on a stretcher in the middle of the stage and the plebeians maintain a respectful distance until  reveals the will whereupon they step right over the body to get closer to this new object of interest. self interest and the politicians who manipulate that have been the ways of republics since the concept of democracy was born. playing that body the second of a dominating three phase performance is benjamin curns. he makes a great s ghost late in the play too but it is his performance as the living breathing strutting peacock of a  that lingers over the play long after hes been killed. curns plays  in white suit and tie like a southern politician as a walking ego a self reflection of greatness. image is all to this  even as he recovers from his epileptic seizure and it is because he is so self aware that he is completely unaware of< how  has been taken aside leaving  alone and suddenly surrounded by dangerous men and by extension  is unaware that  not  whom he had suspected most has become the most dangerous. as  rambles on about what it is to be  we see the assassins ready themselves. watching them moving into position watching them stealthily withdrawing their knives from their shirts and waistbands watching them glancing at each other for cues and assurance and watching  chris ston turning a minor character into an indelible part waiting for the exactly perfect moment to strike is thriller theater at its best. we know whats coming but this detailed build up gets your heart beating just a little faster and your shoulders leaning forward in space. i think my mouth was suspended in a gape too. liberty freedom tyranny is dead  shouts after  falls. but tyranny is not dead. et tu brute. et tu.,5,Tragedy,Positive
Julius Caesar,Gritty Caesar is a Visual Treat,Craig Melson,from the outset immersion theatres gritty production of   clearly wants to do something original. the opening replaces the original dialogue with a montage of horrific violent acts supported by a deafening led zeppelin inspired soundtrack showing how lawless this bohemian dystopia as it was advertised really is. indeed the visuals and the spectacle make this production at the brockley jack in south london excellent. the characters are dressed in grungy leather and props are limited to metal bins and chains helping shift the play away from rome circa 44bc and allowing more connection to today. many of the themes are still acutely relevant such as the rule of the mob political types manipulating each other and the everyone out for himself attitude. the visuals are supported by well choreographed dancing and military training scenes supervised by jess mack which are intelligently placed into the production. other set pieces such as wheeling out s corpse in a shopping cart and seeing the  violently murdered on the streets by a gang help create a lawless atmosphere. the theatres ambience and atmosphere are fully exploited. in keeping with rachel cartlidges grungy leather costumes the lighting is mostly dark creating heavy shadows and keeping much of the space in almost pitch black. there is a danger it could be too dark in places but the design by viktor palfi keeps the balance just right. in a notable move co directors james clifford and rod morgan cast  and  as women. for  anna bond this interesting take does not have much impact as  features sparingly in the play but for  it allows the co directors to change completely the dynamic between her and the male co conspirators.  brilliantly played by rochelle parry is portrayed as a jealous sister type who sexually manipulates  liam mulvey into following her plans. her femininity adds an extra layer of complexity into her relationship with the animal like  frank teale and  seducing them into following her will. the play is cut down and runs in two halves with the first half building up to the inevitable and famous assassination and the second half focusing on the consequences. the editing works well as it cuts down the peripheral characters and dialogue and presents the fast paced action and conspiracy scenes. both parts have their own unique atmosphere the first is intimate and tense and the second aggressive and energetic. the assassination is especially compelling. as the conspirators lay into  they abuse and torture her with the audience only snatching glimpses due to the strobe lights and killing in the name of blaring at 100 decibels. you could just about see the performers running around the stage until the spotlight fell on the dying  waiting for the final stab from her friend. it is a sensory overload and an apt ending to a tense first half. the second half focuses on the famous revenge by marc . as the first half led up to the senate house on the ides of march the second leads to the climactic battle of phillipi. james cliffords portrayal of marc  is convincing and he takes the audience on his journey from anger to grief to a desire for revenge. mulvey stands out as well in the funeral oration in which he conveys his conflict and despair. the battle scene generally is well crafted and sees all the players brawling hand to hand moving in and out of slow motion. the key piece of direction comes as the ghost of  walks through the battle to plunge the sword into . there are times when the production frustrates because of an element of confusion. with everyone looking the same it is hard to distinguish who is on whose side especially at the battle of phillipi where it is hard to determine who is winning. the dark set is sometimes too sparse and clean so some dumpsters or dirt could have made the point come across better. as a text   can work in many contexts and this near future blade runner style production demonstrates how relevant the play can be delivering a real sensory treat.,4,Tragedy,Positive
Julius Caesar,RSC's Caesar Strikes Too Close To Home,Christopher Adams,in 1601 just before the earl of essexs uprising a specially commissioned performance of richard ii was played for the would be usurpers. s words no doubt already politically sensitive when he penned them took on a heightened meaning in the tenser political climate. some 400 years later it is another of his plays   that resonates with unintended political reverberations. in romes struggle of empire preoccupation with violence and groundswell of political activism s vision possesses eerie resemblances to americas own fractured political wrangling. art and life seem too close in imitation with one another. in lucy baileys production of   for the rsc continuing the companys winter residence at the roundhouse theatre in london disquieting undertones of modern political life seep through a dramatic and blood filled staging of s thriller. nothing in the program nor the production explicitly calls attention to the plays parallels to modern political events or discourse but such is the nature of the whirligig of time that such parallels become hard to ignore.  played to deeply disturbing effect by  ryan brandishes a dagger while exclaiming so every bondman in his own hand bears the power to cancel his captivity which could just as easily be a slogan associated with the national rifle association. ryan portrays  as mentally disturbed and bloodlusty.   mackay manipulates s penchant for overblown ideological railing to implant the idea of s assassination inception but in the span of a few speeches. parallels with current partisan rhetoric are all too easy to find. violence and blood pervade this   and bailey certainly knows how to grab attention. the production opens with an intense fight to the death between remus joseph arkley and romulus tunji kasim the mythical founders of rome an extra textual device that prepares for the violence to come. the second half of the show opens with even grislier images.   darrell dsilva apparently fresh from battle enters carrying a human head. he sits on a throne reading a list of names of potential executees. a prisoner enters dragged across the diagonal length of the stage screaming before vomiting blood. toward the end of the scene in a bit of dark humor  tosses the head to  arkley on the line we must straight make head.  dudleys design focuses on several shifting slats at the rear of the stage set at diagonals onto which are projected at appropriate moments images of jeering crowds. a wide space above the slats also holds projection varying among images of s statue burning buildings or ominous undergrowth. the production exhibits a tension between the flat projections and the physical combat. sarah dowlings movement direction and philip dorléanss fight sequences are vibrant and adrenaline packed. during the crowd scenes the company members appear alongside the projection a somewhat awkward juxtaposition. but django batess brassy music creates an even further level of uncomfortability and aural violence. the company is put to good work. dsilva the most consistently engaging of the lead actors makes a perfect gem out of  understatedly crass and brutish at first before turning into a gifted manipulator. he escapes the horror of ponderously delivering friends romans countrymen lend me your ears by having to shout the line since the crowd noises fresh from s speech are so uproarious this is a plea for attention. sam troughtons  is painfully uptight he seems to be holding his very atoms together through a force of will. his angular gestures relax after he bathes his hands in s blood and he delivers the funeral oration with clinical precision a gripping performance. greg hickss characterization of  is harder to understand he presents  as weak especially in his physical movement which seems to spring from his hands or arms instead of having commanding weight and presence. with a lack of gravitas one wonders how this  ever managed to conquer huge swathes of empire. yet he handles the assassination well including a protracted death and his return as s ghost to deliver s death blow a clever directorial touch is especially eerie.   is a male dominated play. hannah youngs self harming  is one of the few voices of pity and restraint. testosterone sweat dirt and blood are generously applied. the language of political ideology as an incitement to and justification of violence comes uncomfortably close to our modern era. in s explanation of s assassination he says if then that friend demand why  rose against  this is my answer not that i lovd  less but that i lovd rome more. had you rather  were living and die all slaves than that  were dead to live all freemen? the state motto live free or die here is followed to a twisted conclusion and the conspirators proclamation liberty freedom and enfranchisement follows as staged by bailey a gruesome and bloody murder. and dsilvas brilliant working of s funeral oration to turn the crowd from foe to friend could easily be todays commentators making use of social networking to inflame the blogosphere. though  has long been said to reflect the human condition his portrayal of violence brutality and bloodshed combined with a preoccupation with the power of language and rhetoric strikes too close to home.,4,Tragedy,Positive
Julius Caesar,"A Muscular, Articulate Julius Caesar in the Texas Hills",Michael Meigs, the conspirators of the ides of march are deep at work in the hills south of austin texas. even though wimberley is a township with a population of fewer than 4000 people  under the stars at the emilyann theatre is currently staging a muscular and articulate   that is well worth the winding forty five minute drive through ranch country. known principally for summer musicals and the long running annual  under the stars for young people the park and outdoor amphitheatre of the emilyann have served as a community gathering point for the past eleven years. newly appointed theatre operations manager bridget farias who directed the comedy of errors and the winters tale in previous seasons has expanded the program by recruiting experienced ans from austin for s four weekend run. outdoors in october? that seems entirely plausible during this past summers drought and record breaking heat but rains and relatively cooler weather have moved in since mid september. texans arent used to chill and many in the audience this past saturday were wrapped in blankets as the evening temperature sank into the mid 60s. but no one was leaving. farias places the action in an indeterminate now in which  is besieged by a press corps and marc  wears camouflage pants while running his race.  sticks an automatic pistol into his waistband but prefers his switchblade. these are visual changes for the most part. the text is abridged somewhat but rarely altered. for example  brandishes his automatic pistol in act 4 during his quarrel with  when he exclaims there is my dagger and here my naked breast  later farias omits the business of  seeking someone to hold steady a sword at his suicide choosing instead the lifting of a pistol a blackout and a shot. capable women actors play   and  so an occasional he becomes she with no loss to the action. this is no cast of rude mechanicals. of the sixteen in the cast and the director twelve have theatre related fine arts degrees or make their living on the stage. five have participated in summer theatre workshops in england most of them with the royal  company. this shows in their mastery of the text the timing of their delivery and in the intensity of this very vigorous production. as  judd farris is sober and intellectual with emotions under tight control. this is in contrast to his lascivious prancing  this past summer and his bumbling sir  aguecheek the year before both done with austins scottish rite theatre. farris establishes  with the self awareness and stature of a tragic hero. opposite him as  played by ernesto roze rosas. rosas is muscular and animated rather than lean and hungry a dangerous man in a fight. his quarrel in act 4 becomes the clash of stiff anglo intellect and latino passion an unexpected texas insight to the play. beyond the  core duo however one wishes for greater reflection from the principals. d. heath thompsons  is an unsmiling public man apparently with little intuition. the implication of the staging is that his agenda is probably set by the latest polls. trey palmers  dissembles adequately with the conspirators and is effective in his grief over s corpse. palmer shows the audience an early unholy glee about his immediate intention to undermine the murderers. with the funeral oration palmer gathers momentum plays with our emotions and thrills the crowd. both the audience and cast members insinuate among them in the amphitheatre. the rhythm here is terrific certainly the fruit of a collaboration between palmer and farias. palmer rouses the populace and they storm off with s body on a bier in a fine climax. but palmer forfeits many of those chips with the audience with a big grin as he delivers his lines now let it work. mischief thou art afoot take thou what course thou wilt special mention goes to daniel lefave as the blunt fellow  the first ordinary conspirator recruited by . lefave portrays  as a physically awkward publicity hack for .  stumbles glowers and grimaces hes ill dressed and credulous exactly the sort of follower or fall guy required for such an enterprise. this production moves fast and far regularly penetrating the audience space or plunging into the semi lighted woods on either side of the stage. for example in act 5  dispatches  rob novak to reconnoiter the battlefront and novak races up the central aisle of the amphitheatre.  and  dustin hensley under pressure and in confusion scan the distance behind the audience and come to the fatal erroneous conclusion that  has been overwhelmed. the emilyanns production sustains the bard and earns considerable credit for the director cast and supporters. the folk of wimberley are well served considering this is one of two very active theatre companies in the community. any austinites not willing to make the drive are missing out. ,4,Tragedy,Positive
Julius Caesar,"The Fault, Dear Brutus...",Michael Kostroff, declan s is a youthful dedicated theatre company whose members exhibit great camaraderie and a true love for their work. and while a small handful of them really dont belong on the professional stage many are solid actors and a few are quite good indeed. heres the problem. mysteriously theyve chosen to focus all this wonderful dedication and talent on the works of  . i say mysteriously because the companys capacity for handling s work is shaky. not terrible no not by a long shot just shaky. and as a group this just doesnt appear to be their specialty. mind you they try with gusto and commitment and without question in part and in moments they succeed. but ultimately its like a brilliant basso attempting to sing a tenor aria. hell hit some of the notes but surely not all. and while his singing talent may be evident its not something youd necessarily want to hear. declan s current production   has its share of those successful moments but it still comes up short. companies that specialize in  should ideally have a deeper hold on the material than this. in his first time at the helm company artistic producer erwin tuazon despite his  background has directed a  that for all its efforts at being terribly dramatic sorely lacks trajectory build drive and emotional stakes. the pace is laboriously slow and very little is played with convincing gravity or intensity. and while most of the players seem to understand the words theyre saying few of them dig deeper than the surface now im angry i dont like her now im giving a big speech. theyre doing their best serious acting without fully grasping whats going on. their emotions often seem arbitrary and sometimes theyre inexplicable. moments after s murder  s messenger enters the senate chamber. rather than trembling in fear for her life in this room full of blood smeared assassins she gives them sassy snarky attitude much in the same way kids do nowadays as if giving them a piece of her mind unaffected by the crumpled body of the dead leader that lies only a few feet away. tuazon should have caught this glaring misunderstanding of the scenes circumstances. this is just one of many such moments in the production. when ad libs from the angry mob elicit howls of laughter from the audience it ought to be taken as a sign that something has gone rather wrong with your . in this version of the story many of the male characters have become female. when done well this kind of thing can be refreshing and bring exciting new ideas to the text. here jessica temple is a female   a very interesting idea that might have worked had it been seen through with a bit more commitment but under tuazons direction ms. temples  lacks the authority and gravitas usually embodied by women who rule over men and in a rare costuming misstep shes dressed winsomely in girly flowing white when a power suit with good pair of shoulder pads might have helped considerably. as it is shes more gwyneth paltrow than hillary clinton making it difficult to buy her as a revered and respected leader. this power shortage is worsened by overly familiar treatment from other characters particularly   played by company founder and co artistic director jeff holden who romantically plays with her fingers suggesting an affair. this weird departure from the story wasnt thought through. surely such behavior would never be carried out in full view of s spouse and more importantly not in public where  seeks to present the powerful god like image of an unshakable leader. most baffling is the moment when upon arriving at the senate  and various senators pair up and dance together. the device is later repeated as a prelude to s murder. besides being a strange directorial choice seeing  twirled and dipped does little to repair her diminished status.  also a woman in this production is played by lovelle liquigan a fine actress of great presence clarity and power at her best in her scenes opposite j. r. espositos haunted and thoughtful . these are captivating capable players. still and even as they plot s murder an act that could result in their deaths and will surely affect the fate of the entire known world something is lacking in the stakes department. eliza kiss  is a significant standout. her layered passionate performance provides one of the most engaging and truthful moments of the evening and is one of the few that goes beyond the broad strokes. the perky and adorable lourdes uribe is simply in the wrong play. she appears in several roles including s messenger and in each seems to believe shes there for comic relief playing for laughs as  servant  and even as the doomed  the poet in what is normally among the most chilling scenes in the play. its like sticking a character from threes company into medea. frank astrans set is an imposing assembly of cement columns topped with wire fencing and framed in draped white fabric. it provides a sense of an imposing city and its halls of power. the design works well as a setting for the senate and various roman homes but not quite so well for the fields of war in act two. in the costume department director tuazon triumphs creatively combining various styles and eras into a beautifully unified stage picture of dark hues in tight severe lines.  wears a tough looking black suit and no nonsense stilettos the  appears as a homeless protester and citizens are convincingly blue collar in caps and sweaters. particularly against astrans light grey set the dark palette works exceptionally well and the garments with the previously noted exception of s dress give great indications of the characters. tuazon also chose the music which is excellent. it seems a shame for declan s to expend its resources of talent and dedication on work that seems just beyond their reach. it would be exciting to see these same worthy performers take on some challenging and engaging modern works like rhinoceros or 12 angry men or in gods country or jean claude van italies interview or even the cradle will rock. or perhaps theyre in need of more seasoned  directors who could better guide and elevate their well intentioned efforts. but to tackle  without the necessary analytical tools is like trying to dig a tunnel with spoon.   runs through september 27th fridays and saturdays at 8

Julius Caesar,"Like a Colossus, Marin Shakespeare Competes With the Heavyweights",Denise Battista,one might say barry kraft has done it all when it comes to . kraft has acted in all thirty eight of s plays with more than one hundred roles and eighty four productions under his belt. hows that for gusto? hes also served as dramaturge at the oregon  festival for twenty three seasons. kraft last acted on the marin  stage in 2006 reigning supreme in the title role of king lear. now he gives his all as   and although we love kraft this is not a particularly likable .  he enters from above like a god tossing laurel wreaths to the people below and presidential baby kissing as he descends into the masses. this  is arrogant and almost snide. hes also frail and theres no doubt this  suffers from the falling sickness as kraft enters the stage beaded in sweat his hand shaking and with portentous evidence of a fall swelling on his forehead. when on the stage kraft commands it. when he falls to the stage his death is swift cold and brutal but it is at that epic moment et tu brute? that kraft breaks our hearts. the subtle silence between kraft and jay karnes  in the seconds that follow these three famous words is a supreme moment in time. television actor jay karnes plays  and most importantly he plays  as a complicated strong thinking and flawed man with a conscience. while karnes comes to marin  via kraft and his acting affiliation at the oregon  festival in the mid 1990s karnes is best known for his seven season run as l.a.p.d. detective holland dutch wagenbach on the fx drama the shield which ended its final season in november 2008. film and other television credits apply i saw him in an episode of house. his role as  is memorable. although karnes is at times a bit rigid with the language especially early on its somehow okay as his manner of pronounced speaking sets him apart from the rest of the cast. karnes is magnanimous and one of the pretty people. hes statuesque offering a certain dignity and grace to his character and his slight sneer not quite like elvis but one cant help but make the connection is oddly appealing. karnes is a seasoned actor who understands the subtle nuances necessary to convey  stoic emotions and his troubled mind. its almost as though karnes allows us to see into the mind of his character and feel the impossible quest of his conscience that battles with honoring his loyalty to  and honoring his loyalty to the republic. unlike  we do like  only because karnes somehow slips a sympathetic vein into this complicated roman patrician and as far as we can tell  is an honorable man. while the play is called   the real drama is that of . karnes captivates. jack powell who also plays  in this seasons worthy adaptation of twelfth night takes the role of .  powell is a master of s language turning verse into perfectly intoned conversation. hes seductive in soliloquy and chilling in the eye or as the eye of the storm. just as we see a ed change in  from the beginning to the end of the play  also edly changes and the change is confusing. it should be confusing as we cant quite grasp if  is good or bad or both or neither. he too is a complicated character and somehow because of his eventual love and loyalty to  at least insofar as powell plays  we end up at the very least not hating him but rather trying to understand him and his motivations. in this powell provokes thought and his character will no doubt be the topic of conversation after the show. i spoke briefly with powell at the cast party following opening night and asked him about his motivation for the change in his character from sinister to somehow right in the end. powell told me that after the death of   becomes depressed he gives up. he wants to die and when  does slay himself in act five its not the effect of his best friend being slain on the battlefield but it was an already present wish that was just waiting on the act to make it complete. ive yet to wrap my head around this interpretation and im somewhat glad i didnt gather it from powells performance as i dont quite see how it fits but again  is a complicated character. powell proves that on and off the stage. others also wow. cat thompson as  wife  is strong striking and seductive and just the kind of woman who would voluntarily stab herself in the thigh and swallow hot coals.  elsman as   whether in his skivvies a toga or a uniform delivers a commando commanding performance throughout. again heres a character who edly changes. elsman proves one hell of an orator as he woos the plebeians and audience with his gripping friends romans countrymen  then displays a vicious man full of ambition foreshadowing the tumult that follows the end of act five. just have a read of  and cleopatra to know what i mean. stephen klum as  is sarcastic flamboyant and corrupt and just plain fun for the eye and ear. klums depiction has a somewhat comedic bent though its the type of funny that leaves you unsettled. in speaking he puts on this tardy form a sort of snooty rudeness in tone lingering the tail end of his words. he comes across as bitter and gossipy and unstable with a hint of vicious to his nature. hes also the first to stab  and in the back to boot. klums portrayal supports this act. the players are appropriately draped in classic togas baring their toes in strapping sandals. and when soldiers the actors are vibrant in their roman centurion helmets and breastplates. dont be alarmed when elsman enters at the start of the play in what can best be described as a green silken diaper. it took me some time to realize that costume designer claire townsend swaddles elsman in this revealing ensemble because his  and other noble youths are running through the streets of rome for the lupercalia festival which honors romulus and remus the founders of rome. the festival which takes place on february 15 is an important er of time in the play letting us know that a solid month of thought passes before  agrees to and engages in the assassination of  on the ides of march.  robinsons set design focuses on the classical elements of symmetry balance and order with a left stage to right stage mirror image stone façade that features entrances and stairways marble busts and a sense of the eternal. and at the top of the stairs is a promontory on which orations are made and wreaths thrown topped with the image of the capitoline wolf and the spqr for the senatus populusque romanus. billie cox offers thoughtful and exciting sound design with her original score. scenes of flourish are accompanied by epic music that parallel the silver screen while more thoughtful intricacy announces the appearance of s ghost who in this production appears to  three times instead of s curtain call for one. cox conjures constant and measured strings in an eerie g against an f followed by an f and then a c. this harmony which was known as the diabolus in musica in ancient times creates a cacophony of discord upon which the ghost of  walks. ellen brooks offers this productions lighting design which works although it had the opportunity to be more reable. lightning flashes and appropriate fade in and outs occur but brooks use of pretty red lighting after death scenes doesnt go far enough. for the brutal animalistic intensity assigned to the gory assassination of  as well as poor  the poet  lucas mcclure plays both s in this production and even the stoic suicides of  and  i cant help but want a shining like flood of deep red light overtaking the stage.  a rosy glow upstage just doesnt make the cut. the cast seems to lose some of their gusto in act five beginning with a relatively anticlimactic fight scene fight direction by brian herndon. and they never seem to get the momentum back to that exhilarating level of the previous four acts. opening night curse? perhaps. if these players and director robert currier included can figure out a way to keep that excitement flowing and the audience engaged theres no reason why the amphitheatre shouldnt burst to their feet for the proverbial curtain calls. from beginning to almost end this production engages shocks and confounds. like good theatre should this show takes you out of your seat out of your life and into the world of the play. its by far the most spectacular production ive seen on the marin  companys stage.,5,Tragedy,Positive
Julius Caesar,Julius Caesar From the Heart,Melissa Crismon,rain threatens san diego on this strangely cool august evening. a group of twelve actors ranging in age from nine to seventeen perform a straightforward   at north coast repertory theatre. these young actors were signed up for this six week acting class with no prodding culminating in a three night production. emily north who plays  in this production is all smiles when asked about her experience. i loved it. with her peaches and cream complexion and aqua colored braces she doesnt find the memorization daunting. after working under steve lipinskys direction in the past the hobbit north is enthusiastic to work with lipinsky once again. lipinsky explains the range of emotions in the play such as fear anger jealousy and revenge all perfect for a childrens summer play. all jokes aside lipinsky serves up an abridged form of   in just a little over an hour that focuses on the language and evokes emotion in the actors some of whom have never performed in front of an audience. aaron rumleys sound and subdued lighting design puts emphasis on the acting. drumming music enhances the stabbings and dark moments as does other instrumental music complimenting jan mahs clean costume design true to the period with white robes and a green cloth over the shoulder. without distraction it looks as if these child actors are using their own sandals and perhaps their parents belts. enter  and  performed by chris taylor and erik larson. taylor and larson have tremendous rapport even with their characters opposing personalities and they are spot on with diction phrasing and body language. taylor is a cool and calm  while larsons  is deliberate and persuasive. sharing the stage with taylor and larson hannah hogan is equally commanding as . with the attitude of a teenager hogan props her elbow on taylors shoulder as if she were his buddy or confidante gossiping about how the people love  and how they try to give him the crown three times. hogan and larsons easy tone conjures jealousy in  and adds an uncomfortable air of nonchalance to the coming acts of violence. amanda cowles plays the role of  wife  and comes across as the worried spouse who suddenly does not understand the actions and motivations of her husband. on her knees cowles is sympathetic and sincere and speaks her role from the heart. at around twelve years old jacob surovsky brings out the pomp of  by smirking or holding a hand up to keep the people at bay. this  belittles the people and even pats  on the head to which hogan closes her eyes and buries her emotions. in that pivotal scene the assassination of  a drum beats after every stab until  delivers the final blow of betrayal and in a single yet profound moment surovsky looks up and delivers those three famous words et tu brute? in this fast paced production the energy remains high but moments such as these are jarring and evoke worthy emotion because they are so well executed. of note dakota speas had only two weeks to prepare for his role as   as he joined the summer classes later than his counterparts. speas isnt seen until late in the play his big moment occurs after the murder of . speas cautiously approaches the lifeless body of surovsky apparently fearful of what he sees. on his knees he furrows his brow and mourns the mighty  before shaking hands with the murderers and swiftly exiting the scene. the rest of the cast includes arielle algaze as   lillian as  and  gabe krut as  servant and  chloe sherman as the   and lucillius hannah green as  and  and two adult mentors matt thompson as   and sunny smith as    and messenger. matt thompson is north coast reps theatre school director receiving his m.a. in theatre from san diego state university while teaching master classes through the la jolla playhouse education department. sunny smith who helped with props said it was mulled over whether to use skateboards in this production but in the end the decision was made to focus less on props and angles and more on s language. the simple and well crafted set design by  finkbinder and marty burnett was originally used for the production dont dress for dinner and serves the purpose of creating places to exit and enter on opposing sides of the stage. for   some gold paint has been added to the walls with a touch of ominous red dripping on the stairs. from the set design to the costumes this   is a classic production appropriate for all ages. smith says none of the children are here because their parents made them go to camp and as the actors line up for curtain call chris taylor chooses to remain in character as the tragically flawed . these young actors thoroughly enjoy being on the stage and truly follow the lead of their mentor matt thompson who advises acting from the heart is the most sincere form of performance. for more information on north coast repertory theatre their current season and theatre school visit northcoastrep.org.,4,Tragedy,Positive
Julius Caesar,Boredom from Julius Caesar? NYC Buries Pigeon Creek,Roseanne Wells,pigeon creek  company which originally hails from grand haven michigan brings their production of an all female   to the downtown theater scene in new york. summer is never a good time to tour new york with  because the native offerings are so plentiful. but even in the off season this production would not have made the cut. the production begins with an acoustic off pitch version of the foo fighters there goes my hero which is only the first time the cast abuses the bands music to reinforce the plays themes. this introduction moves into a dialogue between two cast members under the pretense that they are declaring new roman laws asking audience members to turn off their cell phones. instead of being pithy and refreshing the mini scene drags on as they describe the original theatrical practices or why their production values are minimal and perfectly mediocre. half lighting in the house is to recreate the uncontrollable sunlight from the outdoor theater even though it is an indoor black box slight costume changes represent different characters because in case you didnt know in the theater sometimes actors played more than one part and elizabethan law prohibited actresses so they are role reversing sticking it to the man with their all female cast. although perhaps appropriate for a junior high school assembly about an theater this imposed prologue comes off as condescending and childish for an adult audience. to explain theater often diminishes its luminescence.  srb hopes to disguise the female cast members as men in ill fitting tunics with ragged hems apparently made from bed sheets but they just look like women in homemade ill fitting costumes.  from the sound of music did much more tailoring with her curtains. the stark black box could have worked to the companys advantage but the sloppy costumes against the bare stage makes it look amateur instead of streamlined a cost driven choice instead of an artistic one. the company completely misses the culture of rome the pride of its citizens the validity of superstitions and s the homoeroticism of hyper masculine friendships and the distinguished oration that separates romans from men. even the roman s are wordsmiths as proven in the opening scene but there is no sparkle to s words. alisha hubers direction of the text as disconnected from their bodies is vacant and dull i could literally hear the spaces between the beats as if a classroom were sounding out the iambs. hubers blocking is more miss than hit glaringly obvious when emily decker as the  is supposed to emerge from a crowd to caution  on the ides of march. instead of being surrounded by bodies decker is left in complete open space on stage right while everyone turns to look at her from stage left. although the plebian crowd scene during the funeral speeches is more effective and uses group movement to create an illusion of more bodies the first one borders on ridiculous. there are also major moments like the first dialogue between  and  during which the characters are completely profile for a significant time muffling their voices and hiding their faces.  mayberry shows no character arc for  she is not conniving or sneaky but rather constantly verges on boringly hysterical when trying to convince  to join the faction. heather folkvord as  oddly takes on s slyness laughing at awkward moments and looking suspicious at times. it is difficult to believe that such a one dimensional man could spend sleepless nights thinking about morality justice and civil duty tormented by the thought of killing his ambitious friend. kathleen bode as  is bland with a touch of the right arrogance but certainly not a charismatic leader for the blind masses. she is more fervent as  the poet emphasizing the random havoc of the incensed crowd. marc  sarah stark sports a scrunched brow and a farsighted squint but starks grumpy facial expressions do nothing to convey s political acumen or magnetism. her literal gestures detract from the subtle text while her unsupported voice is shrill during his riling funeral oration. folkvord tries to scream over the plebeians to start the proceedings before starks own attempt but the ensemble raises quite a racket to their credit.  kat hermes seems to be the most passionate actor on stage a great contrast to the often blank faces the others display but her head ticks that emphasize the verse are often distracting. arielle leverett is stronger as  than calpurnia more attuned to the ambitious  to be than the subtler intentions of a barren spurned wife. ellie gramer as  is a fresh moment using different vocal levels to express emotion. in a flattering belted toga that contrasts her red locks she is physically maternal with her  and shows some of s strength of character. her double casting as  however is another unsuccessful moment in the production. to provide time for gramers quick costume change two other cast members try to rally the audience into a chanting match pitting rome against freedom. the effort is admirable but with such a small audience and without enough time to get a strong support going the time killer flops. after the assassination and all the talking there is a civil war that is severely underfunded and understaffed as rapiers and short knives are used for battle and  is his own standard bearer. folkvord and mayberry manage to turn the tent scene a masculine challenge of words that almost ends in blows into a girly catfight. the fight choreography is dismal and cartoonish for both the hand to hand combat as well as the suicides spoiler alert its a tragedy a lot of people will die. mayberry preemptively covers her face with a flag for her suicide again muffling her lines and later other people die too but nothing is reable enough to note. unfortunately for pigeon creek they cannot stand up to the other  productions new york is offering this summer.,1,Tragedy,Negative
Julius Caesar,Stars Rise as Mighty Caesar Falls,Denise Battista,in s   the plot is simple.   is an ambitious political leader who wishes to become emperor of rome. a  warns him to beware the ides of march but  disregards this warning and a group of conspirators assassinate  on this date. the conspirators are eventually defeated by friends of  after which rome falls into a state of civil war. while the plot is simple the characters are complex. the plays title character speaks less than one hundred and fifty lines and is assassinated at the start of act 3 yet he must somehow remain present and powerful from beginning to end. matt gottlieb masterfully takes on the title role. his  is insightful and deserving of our respect and remembrance he is noble in character and yes he is ambitious. but gottlieb is not quite the centric  that led harold bloom to refer to him as the northern star of his world. perhaps thats why its difficult to not have complete and utter sympathy for this character when he is so brutally stricken down by his friends his romans and his countrymen. michael ganios set design is simple the festival glens wooden construction also used in this seasons currently running a midsummer nights dream is ordained with crimson columns and curtains and bits of gold leaf offering function and signification over ornate form. b. moderns costume design is contemporary with political figures dressed in suits splashed with a drape hanging loosely over their shoulders and trailing behind.  the plebeians are rough and tumble in appearance and their color palette an appropriate blur of conformity.  rodolfo ortega underscores their mob mentality with his composition of intense metal music signifying blurred chaos and the extreme. not so simple is york kennedys brilliant lighting design creating blinding storms and chaotic battle scenes. he even lights up the forest behind the stage in response to s words announcing the light of day. kennedy creates mood excitement and brings power to this plays tragic drama. other stars surround gottlieb. scott wentworth is amazingly strong as . he walks heavily upon the stage as a tragic stoic troubled and torn man who as far as we know is noble in his motives and is a friend first and foremost to the roman republic. but we cant forget that he is also an assassin who achieves this status by his own will. director  sipes stages  initial interaction with the other main conspirators  and  with fascinating subtlety. david a. moss as the gossipy brutal and blunt  david a. moss sits down center stage in a hazy cloud of cigarette smoke with  chris butler convincing wentworth that  is indeed dangerously ambitious and must therefore be undone. wentworth paces behind the men his judgment clouded by the encircling smoke. the next scene with butler and moss continues in a haze of thick fog accompanied by sound designer norman kerns ominous and booming thunderstorm.  it is during butlers first soliloquy that we realize his presence is a gift to this stage and that his character is far left of sinister. butlers accent takes on a slight southern bent and his lines sometimes sound preachy and melodic but this works well with his dangerous charisma his joker smile his manipulative sarcasm and the pure and utter joy he gets out of gathering his flock and conspiring to commit murder. if not for  self interest he would be an iago reveling in the manipulation and destruction of others for the sake of we know not what. but again the characters are complex and we dont always despise . frankly we cant because butlers just that good. but the fault is not in our stars. while butler gottlieb wentworth and moss consistently shine in their roles others are uneven or even ordinary and while the death of  is monumental and heartbreaking some of the lesser scenes in the play are sluggish. jonathan david visser marc  is larger than life in his soliloquy as he roars havoc after the death of . he proves himself a skilled orator as he seduces the plebeians ears with his famed friends romans and countrymen  monologue but other times visser is flat lacks zest and is not at all a marc . lanise antoine shelley who plays  wife  is strong yet feminine robust even on her knees and passionately beautiful while emily kitchens as s wife  is unreable outside of being awkward and too young for her . aldo billingslea is perfectly frightening as he lurches through the audience like the swamp thing to warn  to beware the ides of march but he later steps onstage and seems quite normal and something of a scrappy rastafarian. but the murder of poor  the poet zarif kabier sadiqi is violent and gruesome and the set design at that moment screams that the roman republic has gone to fiery hell.  sipes fight direction and battle scenes are brilliant and breathtaking and the fickle whimsy of the plebeians is tragically comical. and while the central moment in the play the assassination of  is gripping and will leave your breath inside your body until mighty  falls it is the complexity of  his stumble and fall from grace that remains the the tragic draw of  . ,4,Tragedy,Positive
Julius Caesar,An American Caesar,Michael Kostroff, if youve never seen a play at theatricum botanicum you need to go period regardless of whats playing. the experience of sitting in this outdoor theatre in the serene leafy woods of topanga canyon watching a classic performed by a dedicated seasoned company of players who truly know what theyre doing is too good to miss. its also one of l.a.s hidden treasures. in their current production of   director and company artistic director ellen geer takes what seems to be a distinctly american approach. its brash accessible and un starchy. its got breath and blood and life in it. these romans dont pose and intone they talk to each other sometimes overlapping each others sentences like real people do. the senators are politicians glad handing and backstabbing and they look like they really live in those robes and sandals. this is also some of the best ensemble work youll see anywhere. the townsfolk and soldiers played mostly by interns dont just stand around silently like movie extras they break off into private arguments they erupt and they have to be quieted yet even as a mob they seem to be thinking as individuals. background adlibbing in  can be tricky so ensemble members are often afraid to speak unless they have specified lines. perhaps they fear usually with justification theyll sound jarringly modern so youll hear one lone fellow yell we shall hear more of this or something because thats all  wrote. these players are different. they place themselves in the world of the play and when they adlib often in the aisle right beside your seat they continue to sound like an characters. one gets the sense that had  followed any of their stories instead of those of  and marc  they would have been just as compelling. the principals are good too. mike peeblers  is quietly conflicted with a combination of strength ethics and inner consternation that makes us really concerned for him. peeblers is a true and thoughtful performance with just one nagging hiccup his habitual mid sentence pausing. very shatner not so . peebler is at his strongest opposite susan angelos . the two share such honest chemistry that we wonder if we should be hearing these very personal exchanges. angelo is the real deal. in her brief stage time she is complex passionate and the embodiment of her line i have a mans mind but a womans might. aaron hendrys marc  isnt the typical carved out of marble square. hes a player and a jock trailed by the ladies and even distracted by one at the crucial moment before s stabbed. this is a choice that finds justification in  description  he is given to sports to wildness and much company. hendrys delivery of the famous funeral speech is beautifully motivated intensely interactive with the crowd and unencumbered by pomp. he is invested in his task not the sound of his own voice and he never shies away from the possibility that  is both manipulative and ambitious himself. i cant quite reconcile the decision to cast the supremely talented melora marshall as . part of the theatricum family since the early days ms. marshall is a masterful presence in any role and as always her work is fascinating to watch. her  is charged up like an exposed electrical wire. shes edgy bitter and ever ready to draw sword. but while creative casting is exciting when it works marshalls small stature delicate features and reedy voice make her gender difficult to ignore. as a result one focuses more on whether shes pulling off the illusion than on the story. alan blumenfelds  is brilliant. sarcastic cynical judicious in his alliances its easy to believe he moves in political circles. he brings a great dry humor to the role and the audience is delighted. but for me the highlight of the evening is carl palmers perfectly imperfect  . in his theatricum debut palmer plays  as a man who having been elevated to godlike status has started to buy his own hype. some might say his performance is strikingly reminiscent of a very recent u. s. president. publically he plays the powerful authoritative image. privately hes a boys club glad hander and a bit of a joker faking a punch at a senators gut then ribbing him for flinching. when he gets serious and puts his foot down theres something hollow and watery in his resolve. this  doesnt quite fill the wreath. its a brilliant interpretation. shon leblanc of valentinos costumes works his usual magic with work a day romans in earthy shades senators in red trimmed white robes marc  draped in flashy purple and a thousand brilliant little details from clasps to trim. theres never much manmade scenery at theatricum. the vast open stage has a few wooden structures that provide doors stairs ramps columns and balconies. these are dressed a little differently for each play. one of the best features of the stage is that it has no back wall thus the surrounding woods become part of the set. for  geer uses this landscape to great effect adding intriguing peripheral stories to the one onstage. we see citizens scrambling along the hills to get out of the imaginary rain armies gathering in the distance  addressing an unseen crowd and thereby rome seems to stretch as far as the eye can see. the delightful fact is at theatricum botanicum the line between the stage and the rest of the world is often blurred. before the show calpurnias maid in costume but carrying a clipboard and walkie talkie gives preshow announcements. the theatres entrance gate later becomes the gate to  house. i even saw  the poet between scenes helping an elderly latecomer to her seat. it all swirls together into one pastoral soul edifying experience at the theatre. go ,4,Tragedy,Positive
Julius Caesar,Julius Caesar Takes a Stab at the Shakespeare,Georgina Petronella,  is the first  play i ever read so perhaps it is understandable that i have a sentimental nostalgia for the script. as a bushy haired 13 year old it was the rhythm and melody of the lines that attracted me from the first scenes you blocks you stones you worse than senseless things to the iconic friends romans countrymen lend me your ears speech. i also remember delighting in my entry into a heretofore secret adult club now i too know the origin of it was greek to me and other sayings that passed from s lips to our own. so when i sat down to the  theatres production of   i could not help but feel a rush of anticipation. here at last in the inaugural  play at harman hall are the words of  and   made flesh. but it turns out that much like the fickle townspeople of the play   has been replaced in my affections. my memory of the plot ends abruptly after  s funeral speech and no wonder. as i discovered last night apparently what follows is a lot of military strategizing and battlefield suicides which is so not my thing. if this production is to be believed a lot of the play also consists of a horde of extras running in carefully choreographed patterns onstage while screaming at the top of their lungs. and yes this is the way of large scale well funded productions but i dont think i was in the mood for such a spectacle. the fault dear reader lies not with the production but with me. i would have rather seen something more intimate and sparse and indeed the moments i enjoyed most in the production are exactly that.so lets not focus on your grumpy theater reviewer who clearly needs to watch shows without expecting them to live up to the magic of her first  experience. i should also sulkily note that i would have enjoyed the show more if i hadnt been sitting in the nosebleed section. lets concentrate instead on the handsomely mounted production. starring washington stalwart  long as   a nasally scott parkinson as  and a noble tom hammond as  the men mostly acquit themselves nicely. long in particular brings an amusingly debauched touch to  . here is a lover and a fighter a schemer and a speaker all rolled up in one. long is also one of the most natural speakers of  that i have ever seen. the production got exceedingly lucky in landing him after the original actor was forced to drop out. long is also  in  and cleopatra which is playing in repertory with . the ladies kim martin cotton as  s wife  and nancy rodriguez as s wife  appear long enough to fruitlessly beg their men to stay safe before disappearing.  is menacingly played by dan kremer. he is perhaps more effective dead than alive every time s ghost appears kremer is whiter sterner and more bent on silent revenge than before. the rest of the actors fade into a blur of togas but they do alright. i have to give a shout out to the ensemble actor who fell flat on his face while stampeding off the set unsteadily got back up and then roared freeeedom ala braveheart before hurling himself into the wings.    the set is probably the strongest selling point of the night. designed by james noone it is beautifully and gracefully rendered in a beautiful and graceful space. noone has created a handsomely geometric series of steep staircases oversized wooden doors and balconies that seamlessly shift depending on the needs of the scene. the technical elements are honestly magnificent. the storm scene is frighteningly realistic lighting designer  mccullough is to be commended for his lightning and sound designer daniel baker for his thunder. the lighting in general is blessedly interesting spotlights are used to isolate plotters of s murder and the technique is repeated in crowd scenes to draw us into the reactions of one or two people at a time. the toga heavy costumes by jennifer moeller are perfectly serviceable although the battlefield gear of the varying factions should have been more differentiated. director david muse creates several artful stage pictures with his enormous cast but like i said before i prefer the smaller moments. my favorite scene of the night is between  and his young servant  j. garrett brennan.  plucks on an instrument while singing a lullaby to his weary master in the twilight before battle. brennan has a surprisingly lovely singing voice and the gentle magic of the moment deepens the tenor of the evening. s wife may have disappeared but the good senator still has someone to care for him. there are other thoughtful moments in this production. a townsperson scrawls  on one of the large doors at the start of the play by the end of the night  has been both scrawled and erased on another. the last image of the play of our fallen  is both haunting and hellish. red flags unfurl around his ghostly yet strangely present body even though  is dead he still looms over everything. its nice that the play goes out with a bang considering the protracted blur of fight scenes that has come before it. i lost the thread of why the soldiers kept offing themselves the poor things just began to give up and drop like flies. perhaps they were distraught because their loved ones had bad seats in the audience.,4,Tragedy,Positive
Julius Caesar,ART's Julius Caesar Swings and Misses,Jess Pease,although its sometimes hard to imagine in many modern productions music is a fundamental part of the original experience of s plays. director arthur nauzyciel infuses his american repertory theatre production of   with music up to and including a post production jig reinterpreted as a solid gold pop dance number. nauzycial is ant that all theatre takes place in the here and now but the production design is meant to nod at a 60s rat packcamelot mise en scène thus the greatest part of the music is played by the jazz trio of nne solivan eric hofbauer and blake newman. far from providing background interludes the musicians interact with the actors throughout the play. as the audience returns from intermission  l. montgomery sara kathryn bakker  and calpurnia and some others set up a little soirée with the band to the tune of peggy lees is that all there is until jim true frosts  glares at them to quit it so he can get on with his speechifying. solivan in turn takes the stage in lieu of  in  tent with an apt insertion of suicide is painless. the music swings and solivans vocals especially are smooth and commanding and hit all the right notes. but even a live band is not enough to satisfy nauzycial who along with sound designer david remedios adds somewhat generic sounding mood music behind several scenes. further james waterstons   grieving after s assassination sways and lip syncs to arcade fires my body is a cage. if all that sounds a little mismatched and overwhelming it is. as per the program material nauzyciel is trying to create a dreamscape wherein the dead are replaying their lives through the dreams of a deaf mute child. the deaf mute child in question is in this case  played by jared craig who signs all his lines but one and who remains onstage sometimes watching sometimes lying down and oblivious and sometimes in superman pajamas throughout the play as a silent witness. to establish this otherworldliness nauzyciel summons up a mélange of techniques up to and including c.i.a. approved interrogation tactics to keep the audience unsteady and to shock us out of a complacent viewing. actors speak their lines standing still and upstage rather than interacting with their fellows. some hurry while others move in slow motion at other times they perform synchronized ritualistic actions.  dons an ethan hawkes  esque hat for no apparent reason. blank spaces either in the shape of lines deliberately unspoken or daggers and swords that characters only pretend they are holding abound. the theater itself becomes a confusing and even hostile place. set designer riccardo hernandez backdrops the play in a repeating and overlapping series of photos of the empty theater and suspends a black cadillac over the action of the later acts which lighting designer scott zielinsky illuminates in murky crimson. early on the lighting is gloomy and many of the actors are often hidden in the shadows while during the funeral orations a combination of smoke and harsh light directed both at the stage and at the audience makes it almost impossible to look at the performance. of all the actors on stage only thomas derrah as   really makes an impression as a character. hes a confident charismatic elder statesman who has bought into his own hype. bakker is perhaps a marilyn ish calpurnia and much too cuddly a  but other than the physical she never makes a connection. both true frost and montgomery deliver their lines well enough but are denied a chance to interact save one fleetingly frustrating scene when theyve made up after fighting over supplies and imagined slights. unfortunately with so little characterization earlier in the play the effort falls flat. waterson as   is inconsistently mild mannered and again were just not offered enough emotion to know whats really going on in his head. i suspect that as theyre all supposed to be spectres theres not much thats supposed to be going on in any of their heads. all this is disappointing because you sense that several of them could have turned in very moving performances had things gone differently. the conspirators drawn from the ranks of the arts company move as a pack. they as are all the actors save bakker are costumed by james schuette in identical black suits with skinny ties. as the play degenerates into conflict most everyone strips off their jackets and some their shirts and everyone gets increasingly bloody. its difficult to deduce why nauzyciel pairs all this alienation with s play because rather than giving new insight to the work it simply highlights what this production lacks and what  has in overabundance human characters and connections. although nauzyciels techniques sometimes highlight the raw language it only reminds us that the language means more than simply words.  uses language to create characters and worlds that belong to us in real life and it works best taken straight not at a disassociated distance.,2,Tragedy,Negative
